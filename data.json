I keep a trading journal of my trades and no I’m not going to sit here and list my winners, instead I’m going to mostly talk about my mistakes as this is where I’ve learnt the most valuable lessons and I’d love to share these with you all in the hope that you too can learn from my mistakes:\n\n1) Sizing\n\nSizing is so so important. The main reason I’d ran my port down twice is from poor sizing. I like to be aggressive with my trading style and my allocations but I’ve learnt to set myself limits. I was putting in 30-40% of my port on shitcoins and new launches (hello $bald lol) which repeatedly cost me. My new system with my port larger is now as following:\n\n10-20% allocation per play depending on how early I think I am, and how high my conviction is. You want to make sure you’re maximising your winners. For shitcoins/memes my limit is now 1% but in general since evaluating my journal I’ve tended to trade these less and less (see below). This is a system I’ve set as my port has grown. If you want to build quick with a smaller port then I’d split your port into 2-4 plays and then spread your risk more once you’ve grown your port more.\n\nCorrect sizing also means you don’t over react to red candles. This is a sign I use for myself to decide whether I’ve over allocated. If you’ve over allocated to a play you will panic/worry/stress when it pulls backs, whereas if you’ve sized well you’re far less reactive. Correct sizing leads to better control of emotions.\n\n2) 8 plays accounted for 70% of my profits.\n\nThis showed me that I only need a few good trades throughout the year and don’t need to be constantly looking for new trades. In fact it's clear from my journal that over trading was a big profit killer for me. This also ties into sizing, unless I’m happy to put 10% of my portfolio into a play I tend to stay out (shitcoins aside) and this helps in limiting how many trades I take. Additionally I tended to perform better when I had around 6-8 plays in my port, which makes sense given I was able to keep up with all of them easier.\n\n3) I entered a lot of losing trades straight after closing winning trades\n\nThis is something I noticed about halfway through the year; spurned on by the adrenaline of winning trades I would always look for a new trade for my next dopamine hit as soon as I’d closed the winning trade. This led to many rushed trades without thorough thinking and giving back profits fresh from a winning trade. Interestingly this is something I did far more than when I’d lost trades (I guess I was more aware of not chasing losses).\n\nWhenever I close a trade now (winning or losing) I wait at least a few hours before entering a new trade just to make sure I’m thinking clearly and my judgment is unaffected by the emotions of a win or loss.\n\n4) Ignore previous price action\n\nI’m not saying enter a trade after it’s done a 10x in one hour but instead what I mean is to make your decision on entering a trade based on where the price can go, as opposed to what the price has done so far. Earlier in the year I ignored some plays because they’ve already done a 2x and went onto lose out much much more. Imagine if we did this for $mubi $rlb or $unibot for example. It’s much better to decide where you think the price can go and see how far the play is from that price as opposed to worrying you’re late and the opportunity has gone just because the price has already moved. Similar to this, if you think a coin can do a 5x, then don't fade it if it's moved 10-20%. \n\n5) Adjust your risk based on market conditions\n\nI don’t try and guess where btc is going to go and sell at the opportune moment to then buy back 10-20% lower. Looking back however I think it’s important to at least adjust your risk/sizing based on market conditions. I should also have adjusted my targets. In poorer conditions you should lower your targets for exits in trades. For example from Jan-June and October-Dec we had really nice runs in the market whereas July-September was tougher. I lost a lot of capital in July-Sep as I was forcing trades and sizing as I was in the favourable conditions of the first half of the year. In hindsight I should have reduced my sizing and traded less when the market was tougher. I was too greedy and impatient.\n\nWait for good market conditions, don’t force it in tougher conditions. Adjust your sizing/targets based on the market conditions.\n\n6) New launches and shitcoins\n\nThese are the type of plays where I lost the most money. Yes ofc there is big gains to be made here too but personally this is not my edge and it became clear after a while that my success rate from these is poor. Allocate accordingly and limit how many of these type of trades you're taking, especially if you're newer to the game. Definitely an area for me to improve on in 2024. \n\n7) ‘Psychological comfort’ is an understated factor\n\nI suppose this goes back to allocation and sizing again. When I had a smaller port I felt more comfortable being 100% allocated to active plays. As my port has grown however I've become more uncomfortable having 100% of my port in active positions. This is something well explained by @0x_Kun. The first time I ran my port to 6 figs I remained in nearly 100% active positions and this was psychologically uncomfortable. This led to me worrying more over fluctuations in my port and making some poor decisions as a result. What I like to do now is supply lp in tokenless projects with around 10-20% of my port. This creates a ‘floor’ for my port which I find more psychologically comfortable and results in me reacting less to price movements. Everyone will have a different tolerance to what % of their port they’re happy to have in active positions but my point here is to try and find that sweet spot for yourself as it’ll allow you to remain calmer during pullbacks.\n\n8) Keep a trading journal\n\nTbh I feel a lot of the points I’ve made are nothing new and you’re likely aware of most already but having my journal and having a record of all my mistakes really drummed them all home for me. I’m a firm believer that we learn best from mistakes and the journal has been pivotal in this for me. Don’t be afraid of losing money, it’s part of the process.\n\n9) Keeping your money is the most difficult skill to master\n\nI've already learnt this the hard way twice over. I truly believe crypto is a gift for making life changing money for us all, and if you work hard and put the hours in you can make money from this, but the real trick is learning to keep it. This is part of the reason I like to set a 'floor' in my port too, and I've learnt to take profits to fiat once  in a while also. Whatever you do, make sure you have some sort of end plan, and be very protective over your money once you've made it. Don't suddenly start aping into anything that comes around.\n\n10) Your network is the most valuable asset in this space\n\nLastly it only feels right to give credit to the people who’ve really helped me on this journey and to those who I’ve learned so much from. I’m under no illusions that I wouldn’t have achieved anywhere near what I have without those around me:\n\n@CryptoNikyous - the person to whom I owe the most, he taught me so much in my early crypto days and introduced me to a lot of great traders. Btw he really is an awesome trader too\n\n@resdegen  - one of the smartest minds in the space and best gem finders. I feel so fortunate to have learnt so much from him. He’s also one of the most genuine and moral guys in the space.\n\n@CryptoDamus411 - another super genuine and honest individual, and tbh I really don’t think many people are aware of what an amazing trader he is. His results this year are crazy believe me, and he also really has an eye for a gem\n\n@nanobot_trader - a more recent friend but man is this guy smart. I help him here and there with CoinSense but tbh he is the brains, heart and lungs behind it all and deserves every success he gets for it. Btw don’t underestimate his trading skills\n\n@midoji7 - another absolute giga brain, top tier gem finder and all round nice guy. Idk how he’s still a sub 10k account. I know there’s big things coming from him, so make sure you keep an eye\n\n@Crypt0_Andrew - his knowledge is next level. There isn’t a protocol he doesn’t know about and he’s in every alpha group around. Another super nice individual always open to helping others\n\n@CryptoGideon_  - One of the nicest and most hard working individuals in the space. He deserves every success he gets. Thank you for helping my ct over the year my friend\n\n@xingalong_ - another great friend who helped me early doors and taught me a lot. The man is a master networker and another great trader.\n\n@ItsAverageJO  @IamMusteee  @CryptoYusaku  @Winterz_GGG @shuzeld  - four more recent friends, so much alpha spilled and I feel lucky to be in close contacts with all five guys here\n\n@rektdiomedes - the man whose helped so many smaller accounts early doors, one of nicest and smartest in the space, thank you king\n\n@CryptoShiro_  @arndxt_xo  @crypto_linn @poopmandefi  your support on ct also really helped me on early doors and I’m grateful to all of you\n\n@Crypto_Shaggy @KODOTHH @matrixthesun @kevinle_bw @Aadarsh_Moi  thanks for also supporting me, another 5 great accounts and all round nice individuals\n\nIf you’ve made it to the end well done cos that was a long one and a bit of a ramble, here’s to another big year together!!"

We sincerely apologize to all affected users.\n\n   - When a user submits X transactions in the same block, and the user wins Y prizes (1-6) in that block, the correct statistical data should be Y. However, we incorrectly calculated it as X*Y. This will impact the total number of prizes won by the user.\n\n  - When a user submits X transactions in the same block, the correct statistical data should be X. However, we incorrectly assumed that each user only submits one transaction in the same block. This will impact the statistical data for Total Mint.\n\nThese errors occurred because we initially assumed that users would only submit one transaction per block when using Metamask to mint tickets.

            "full_text": "2023 - Reflecting on the most life changing year of my life\n\nAs 2023 draws to a close, I wanted to write a post about this year which was the wildest most unexpected year of my life. Beyond my wildest dreams and imaginations. I think that I came upon this scene unexpectedly without a lot of ppl knowing where I came from etc so this post will highlight a bit about that but mostly about gratefulness and gratitude to this year and the ppl who helped me along my journey\n\nThe start\n\nAt the start of this year, I was nothing. Not in terms of followers but I was a clueless duck in the land of crypto. I tried trading 10-20% swings on huge coins on binance and followed 'TA' and 'macro' experts. I never did on chain.\n\nI have to thank @KaminoCrypto (long before he was famous, I bleieve he also tried trading 10-20% moves on CEX coins like I did), it was his call on $HERA that made me realise the power of on chain and his tweet that said 'on chain is where the money is made, I'm never going back to CEX' that made me pivot full time to onchain.\n \nI changed my whole approach, found gem hunters on twitter that had a successful track record to start following and tried joining every public tg group. I slowly (by copying others) understood the game and worked everyday to get better. I want to thank @Crypto_Shaggy and @8020_h for basically spoon feeding alfa and trades in public tg groups. Great ppl and great alfa sharers (and also kamino in stfx). It was from this I grew my port of 3 figures to 4 figures in those first few months of learning and experimenting. This was truly the hardest time as starting out is always the hardest.\n\nThe middle\n\nI then by taking my learnings and grinding through twitter/dexscreener/tg groups managed to get into @TheeGHouse  and @UnidentifiedDao  eventually. I got into these by simply showing the grind, the only member of G House to be given NFT through grinding it out in another group and staying in UDAO. I think UDAO gets so much unnecessary hate but its notorious for being difficult to stay in, if ur there and stay in, I think it means something. I dn't rlly see why others want to hate on the DAO. Thank u to @CryptoDet_  and @Govanisher  for giving me the opportunity to prove myself and being so helpful/kind along my journey. Truly if others knew the effort u guys put in, they wouldn’t sit there hatin like they do and actually try create their own alfa groups.\n\nIn these groups, I learnt so much, the way ppl thought. Every single person there taught me something, whether its analysing projects, diff CT accounts, life. I am so grateful for that. One person though I'd like to thank is @Rancune_eth . I don’t know what it is but he took me under his wing and guided me on how to be the best gem finder but also person. I haven't met a gem finder and genuineperson like him in this space. It was also he who motivated me to start posting on twitter and building a brand.\n\nFrom here I found twitter fun especially at the start, I just posted plays I liked and because I was a small account no one cared. Some things went well some things didn't. I grew the account mostly through banana and olas bullposting as well posting what I truly passionately believed in. I cannot fake who I am and what I believe in and hopefully that shows through my posts.\n\nNow\n\nLooking back on this journey, I skipped a lot of parts and people but those first steps into this world were the hardest and I am most grateful to those that helped me and gave me a chance. From being clueless on 3 figs at the start of the year to an amount only I could dream of and frens in the space as well as understanding how to analyse projects, I feel truly blessed. Thank you for this year, to ppl that helped me, to ppl that inspired me and to my followers who I will always try to deliver alfa for. It was a dream come true and I cannot wait to make next year even better.\n\nI'm going to try and thank ppl that helped me a lot. I apologise because I will miss some ppl but plz know I am thankful to all truly.\n\n@Rancune_eth - thank you for everything. You changed my life already with olas and banana but before that u gave me so much advice on not just crypto but life. I am forever thankful and grateful.\n\n@CryptoDet_ - I think u get so much unnecessary hate in this space. You run a great successful DAO that so many wish to get in. Keep doing you\n\n@Govanisher - Thank u for letting me prove myself and changing my life. You are so wise and relaxed\n\n@ItsAverageJO - Jo im so glad we became frens, you are the most underrated account in this space. U do so much analysis and u r one of the best here\n\n@Crypto_Shaggy - u were the first person to reply to my Dms in this space. U run a public group where u kindly give alfa. U r a grinder and thank u for helping me always. I credit so much of this year to the early days of your calls this year\n\n@8020_h - I copied u this year and u don’t need twitter to succeed. U r just a pure pure alfa caller and beast. Thank u especially for how open u are to sharing ur great trade ideas\n\n@KaminoCrypto - thank u for being the reason I went to on chain and sharing plays earlier this year in STFX, got me started in this journey\n\n@defi_antcrypto - We started similar times and grinded together, thank u for ur group and the support u give me\n\n@bobtherebuilt  and @MetaverseRanger  - beyond ur intelligent analysing, the life lessons u give me will stay with me forever\n\nG House fam - u supported me from beginning and let me evolve in a safe environment, appreciate all u bros\n\nUDAO fam - Similarly, thank u for welcoming me and letting me be me there. Bunch of beast grinders\n\n@QuantMeta - u get hate for riddles but keep doing them. I love it, thanks for MQDAO and again letting me prove myself and always having beast plays and ideas. Refreshing\n\n@Cryp__toad - ur the smartest guy in this space, ur constant grind is insane. Look up to u and respect u\n\n@cryptosiem  and @UniswapVillain  - u guys r the best of the best. Thank u for giving me tips and always being open to my DMs. Everyone wishes they could be as good as u guys\n\n@ChadCaff - Thanks for ur support through the year bro, 100k and counting, well deserved\n\n@CryptoKaduna - If only ppl knew how good of a trader u are, I learnt a lot on the way u approach things. For some reason even tho ur one of the biggest names in this space, I feel ur so underrated lol.\n\n@IndianaAltzz  - bro I appreciate ur help on things not just in crypto projects but how to approach situations and ofc ur gem hunting\n\n@V2Chenz  - copied so many of ur great calls when I was starting out, thanks for helping me along this journey bro\n\n@TheCryptoKazi - Appreciate ur shoutouts, guidance and support always\n\n@AmirOrmu - best on chain investigator in the land!\n\n@LouisCooper_ we had some heated debates but u r such a nice person in this space, never got personal or insulted and glad we became frens. Appreciate the xmas gift btw \n\n@AstrologyCrypto - always willing to help newbies, answered my dms even tho i had 0 followers at the time\n\n@0xSleuth_  - big brain dev in this space, one of the few smart gem hunters\n\n@pakpakchicken - appreciate ur support and guidance, still kind of unreal how someone as famous as u saw my post and became frens. \n\n@CryptoUgluuk - been a fan of u for a long time. You r one of the few genuine no bs ppl in this space.\n\n@smolgoingbig @defipeasant - pure grinders/ gem hunters. best of the best\n\nOk guys sorry if i keep going twitter is going to restrict me, many others I missed but they know who they r <3"

However, team and institutional shares will vest gradually, with 10% unlocking for every $1 million increase in market value. The vesting process will continue until all shares are fully unlocked at a market value of $10 million.\n\nThis distribution strategy aims to allocate a significant portion of tokens to the community, fostering widespread participation and engagement. It also ensures resources for ecosystem development, partnerships with strategic entities, support from investment institutions, and incentivizes the team's ongoing commitment and dedication.\n\nStay tuned\n\nSeason 1: 10 days left"

The requirement that before there is a miner controlling 50%+ hashrate there is a way to bribe a minor miner not to censor your transaction, and censorship at individual miner level before that threshold just results not in the global censorship but just in tx fee censorship (poor people will be censored).\n\nOnce we have 50%+-controlling miner the only way to prevent censorship is to run “reverse selfish-mining” by controlling 33% of hash power, which is significantly more expensive than just bribing miners.\n\nAfter a miner or their coalition control 66.7% of hash power, there is no way to escape censorship, even by utilizing “reverse selfish mining” approach as in the case of 50%+.\n\nThe problem that miner pooling enables large miners coalitions and do unlock these 50%+ and 66%+ doomsday scenarios - and it is an old known problem. Stratum v2 was designed as a solution to it - however, even with it, pools still can be required to KYC their individual miners - the part which can’t be solved at all.\n\nClient-side-validation (like used in RGB) and blockchain-less approaches like Prime are the only solution to the censorship problem.

This can be an interesting way to find early wallets, to understand if a project is an alpha or a potential good running early on among other things.\n\nIt also has the potential to sell its API to other projects to add into their bots for additional info and build up partnerships.\n\nIt's a high risk, but I like the odds here at 130K mcap."

This is such a fundamentally incoherent assumption I don’t even know where to start.\n\nThat was when I realized, there are really so many fucking idiots managing so much money in this space aren’t there.

            "full_text": "What a crazy crazy year\n\nAfter some poor trading in 2022, I’d ran my portfolio down to 4 figs which is where I started the year and I would not have believed you if you told me I’d finish the year on 6 figs.\n\nEspecially after I’d reached 6 figs in July and lost it all back down to low 5 figs by end of August\n\nWhats more valuable than the money I’ve made this year is the friends I’ve made along the way, and the lessons I’ve learnt from running up, nearly losing it all and then running up again. I keep a trading journal of my trades and no I’m not going to sit here and list my winners, instead I’m going to mostly talk about my mistakes as this is where I’ve learnt the most valuable lessons and I’d love to share these with you all in the hope that you too can learn from my mistakes:\n\n1) Sizing\n\nSizing is so so important. The main reason I’d ran my port down twice is from poor sizing. I like to be aggressive with my trading style and my allocations but I’ve learnt to set myself limits. I was putting in 30-40% of my port on shitcoins and new launches (hello $bald lol) which repeatedly cost me. My new system with my port larger is now as following:\n\n10-20% allocation per play depending on how early I think I am, and how high my conviction is. You want to make sure you’re maximising your winners. For shitcoins/memes my limit is now 1% but in general since evaluating my journal I’ve tended to trade these less and less (see below). This is a system I’ve set as my port has grown. If you want to build quick with a smaller port then I’d split your port into 2-4 plays and then spread your risk more once you’ve grown your port more.\n\nCorrect sizing also means you don’t over react to red candles. This is a sign I use for myself to decide whether I’ve over allocated. If you’ve over allocated to a play you will panic/worry/stress when it pulls backs, whereas if you’ve sized well you’re far less reactive. Correct sizing leads to better control of emotions.\n\n2) 8 plays accounted for 70% of my profits.\n\nThis showed me that I only need a few good trades throughout the year and don’t need to be constantly looking for new trades. In fact it's clear from my journal that over trading was a big profit killer for me. This also ties into sizing, unless I’m happy to put 10% of my portfolio into a play I tend to stay out (shitcoins aside) and this helps in limiting how many trades I take. Additionally I tended to perform better when I had around 6-8 plays in my port, which makes sense given I was able to keep up with all of them easier.\n\n3) I entered a lot of losing trades straight after closing winning trades\n\nThis is something I noticed about halfway through the year; spurned on by the adrenaline of winning trades I would always look for a new trade for my next dopamine hit as soon as I’d closed the winning trade. This led to many rushed trades without thorough thinking and giving back profits fresh from a winning trade. Interestingly this is something I did far more than when I’d lost trades (I guess I was more aware of not chasing losses).\n\nWhenever I close a trade now (winning or losing) I wait at least a few hours before entering a new trade just to make sure I’m thinking clearly and my judgment is unaffected by the emotions of a win or loss.\n\n4) Ignore previous price action\n\nI’m not saying enter a trade after it’s done a 10x in one hour but instead what I mean is to make your decision on entering a trade based on where the price can go, as opposed to what the price has done so far. Earlier in the year I ignored some plays because they’ve already done a 2x and went onto lose out much much more. Imagine if we did this for $mubi $rlb or $unibot for example. It’s much better to decide where you think the price can go and see how far the play is from that price as opposed to worrying you’re late and the opportunity has gone just because the price has already moved. Similar to this, if you think a coin can do a 5x, then don't fade it if it's moved 10-20%. \n\n5) Adjust your risk based on market conditions\n\nI don’t try and guess where btc is going to go and sell at the opportune moment to then buy back 10-20% lower. Looking back however I think it’s important to at least adjust your risk/sizing based on market conditions. I should also have adjusted my targets. In poorer conditions you should lower your targets for exits in trades. For example from Jan-June and October-Dec we had really nice runs in the market whereas July-September was tougher. I lost a lot of capital in July-Sep as I was forcing trades and sizing as I was in the favourable conditions of the first half of the year. In hindsight I should have reduced my sizing and traded less when the market was tougher. I was too greedy and impatient.\n\nWait for good market conditions, don’t force it in tougher conditions. Adjust your sizing/targets based on the market conditions.\n\n6) New launches and shitcoins\n\nThese are the type of plays where I lost the most money. Yes ofc there is big gains to be made here too but personally this is not my edge and it became clear after a while that my success rate from these is poor. Allocate accordingly and limit how many of these type of trades you're taking, especially if you're newer to the game. Definitely an area for me to improve on in 2024. \n\n7) ‘Psychological comfort’ is an understated factor\n\nI suppose this goes back to allocation and sizing again. When I had a smaller port I felt more comfortable being 100% allocated to active plays. As my port has grown however I've become more uncomfortable having 100% of my port in active positions. This is something well explained by @0x_Kun. The first time I ran my port to 6 figs I remained in nearly 100% active positions and this was psychologically uncomfortable. This led to me worrying more over fluctuations in my port and making some poor decisions as a result. What I like to do now is supply lp in tokenless projects with around 10-20% of my port. This creates a ‘floor’ for my port which I find more psychologically comfortable and results in me reacting less to price movements. Everyone will have a different tolerance to what % of their port they’re happy to have in active positions but my point here is to try and find that sweet spot for yourself as it’ll allow you to remain calmer during pullbacks.\n\n8) Keep a trading journal\n\nTbh I feel a lot of the points I’ve made are nothing new and you’re likely aware of most already but having my journal and having a record of all my mistakes really drummed them all home for me. I’m a firm believer that we learn best from mistakes and the journal has been pivotal in this for me. Don’t be afraid of losing money, it’s part of the process.\n\n9) Keeping your money is the most difficult skill to master\n\nI've already learnt this the hard way twice over. I truly believe crypto is a gift for making life changing money for us all, and if you work hard and put the hours in you can make money from this, but the real trick is learning to keep it. This is part of the reason I like to set a 'floor' in my port too, and I've learnt to take profits to fiat once  in a while also. Whatever you do, make sure you have some sort of end plan, and be very protective over your money once you've made it. Don't suddenly start aping into anything that comes around.\n\n10) Your network is the most valuable asset in this space\n\nLastly it only feels right to give credit to the people who’ve really helped me on this journey and to those who I’ve learned so much from. I’m under no illusions that I wouldn’t have achieved anywhere near what I have without those around me:\n\n@CryptoNikyous - the person to whom I owe the most, he taught me so much in my early crypto days and introduced me to a lot of great traders. Btw he really is an awesome trader too\n\n@resdegen  - one of the smartest minds in the space and best gem finders. I feel so fortunate to have learnt so much from him. He’s also one of the most genuine and moral guys in the space.\n\n@CryptoDamus411 - another super genuine and honest individual, and tbh I really don’t think many people are aware of what an amazing trader he is. His results this year are crazy believe me, and he also really has an eye for a gem\n\n@nanobot_trader - a more recent friend but man is this guy smart. I help him here and there with CoinSense but tbh he is the brains, heart and lungs behind it all and deserves every success he gets for it.

Seed investor tokens are fully locked for 4 years and vested over an additional 4 years, hence keeping emissions low for the first few years.\n\nThe $LNDX Flash Sale sold out in 42 mins, bringing the total funds raised to $8.38M. 55% of the circulating supply at launch will be community-held, launching on @gate_io and @MEXC_Official on 14 December.\n\nHere are the other projects you need to keep an eye on too!\n\nBig Caps:\n\n$LINK @chainlink\n\nChainlink will likely be the biggest price feed provider for all RWAs onchain.\n\n$HBAR @hedera\n\nHedera is a high speed L1 that is diving into RWAs such as on-chain carbon credits.\n\n$CANTO @CantoPublic\n\nCanto is an EVM-compatible L1 built on Cosmos that offers Free Public Infrastructure that utilizes RWAs.\n\n$POLYX @PolymeshNetwork\n\nPolymesh is an institutional-grade permissioned blockchain built specifically for regulated assets.\n\nMid Caps:\n\n$LMR @HelloLumerin\n\nLumerin offers a decentralized marketplace that enables the trading of BTC hashpower.\n\n$DUSK @DuskFoundation\n\nDusk is an L1 that uses ZK technology and enables tokenization of RWAs.\n\n$STRX @TradeStrikeBVI\n\nStrikeX offers a self-custody wallet and tokenization of RWAs.\n\n$TRU @TrueFiDAO\n\nTrueFi offers institutional loans and real-world credit.\n\nSmall Caps:\n\n$GB @grandbase_fi\n\nGRAND BASE is a decentralized market for synthetic RWAs designed to provide exposure to RWA without holding the underlying.\n\n$LEOX @galileoprotocol\n\nGalileo focuses on the tokenization of luxury assets and e-commerce.\n\n$LAND @Landshareio\n\nLandshare aims to tokenize Real Estate and offer such investments on the blockchain.\n\nSpecial thanks to @landxfinance for making this post possible!

This can be something broader like the ETF announcement or DOJ (Binance case). \n\nLately, it's become common for teams to do 'announcements of announcements'. These usually have steady buildups and then volatility during the actual announcement. \n\n1) $GRT \n\nGRT pumped nearly 50% after the announcement of announcement. In this case, they gave a specific day but no time when the announcement would be dropped. The announcement was overhyped but due to risk-on market conditions, there was no significant dump on the news. \n\n2) $OCEAN\n\nIn this case, the exact time was given for the announcement. It took place in worse market conditions and we got a full bart. \n\nNewsly Profiles\n\nIn all of these cases, it's useful to have a separate notification stream. Whether you're already in the position and will need to make a decision on the announcement or whether you want to short if the announcement is lackluster. \n\nYou can create a new profile for any piece of expected news, pin the channel so it's always on top, and turn on loud notifications. \n\nYou can then filter the profiles to only bring news with the keyword \"GRT\" or \"Ocean\" for example. \n\nIt's simple and takes 5 min to set up, join the TG if you need help setting it up and I or any team member can assist\n\nExample profile: \n\nETF News\nInclude keywords: ETF, blackrock, ishares, ericbalchunas\n\nTo take Profiles to the next level: Group Chats\n\nhttps://t.co/gznNRctRdU"

If it is not readable by a non-tech executive, re-write it.\n- The description needs to start with a summary of the functionalities in play, then dive into the root cause, and finally outline the scenario that achieves the highest impact.\n- When suggesting fixes, spend an extra 10 minutes considering if these would introduce new issues and if so, include those risks in the mitigation section.\n- Use client's test suite to provide POCs instead of writing from scratch. It would be more readable for them and they get free regression tests.\n\nAbove tips apply for reports on all platforms & audits.

To avoid any error messages after September 27, please modify your configurations as follows: \n\n🟦Validators: The Blocknative Relay will return a 503 error with “no builder bid”. Ensure your Validators are connected to multiple MEV-Boost Relays and have local building enabled. Remove the Blocknative Relay from your Validator configurations.\n\n🟦Third-Party Block Builders: Blocks you submit to the Blocknative Relay will return 503 error codes. Please remove the Blocknative relay from your submission list.\n\n🟦Searchers: Bundles you submit to the Blocknative auction gateway will return a 503 error code. Please remove the Blocknative endpoint from your configuration.\n\n🟦Blocknative Protect Users: Please update your RPC endpoint to the Transaction Boost endpoint: https://t.co/Cr6uuM9UXM. Otherwise, when sending a transaction, you will receive a 503 error code.\n\nWe are making these changes to focus our efforts on economically viable opportunities that align with our values, interests, and capabilities.\nIf you have questions, please reach out to us on Discord or send us a DM here. 🫡"

This initiative seeks to better position Avalanche to cultivate and support the many new forms of creativity, culture, and lifestyle that blockchain enables.\n\nAlongside prominent cryptoasset categories like gas tokens, DeFi tokens, Real World Assets (RWAs), NFTs, stablecoins, and governance coins, meme coins have carved out a significant niche in the cryptoasset landscape. These coins, often inspired by internet culture and humor, go beyond mere utility assets; they represent the collective spirit and shared interests of diverse crypto communities.\n\nThe Avalanche Foundation intends to start using Culture Catalyst to recognize and encourage the culture and fun symbolized by meme coins by purchasing select Avalanche-based meme coins to create a collection. This move complements the Avalanche Foundation's ongoing engagement across the Avalanche ecosystem, including NFTs, RWAs, and other types of cryptoassets, broadening its portfolio to embrace a more complete spectrum of possibilities. \n\nThe selection process for this collection is based on several key criteria, including the number of holders, liquidity thresholds, project maturity, principles of a fair launch, and overall social sentiment, among other factors. \n\nThe Avalanche Foundation is dedicated to supporting diverse and culturally significant initiatives, establishing its position as an adaptable and inclusive participant in the Web3 space."

Meanwhile, Chinese traders are in a growing frenzy over Bitcoin inscriptions and ordinals while exchanges have signaled support with BRC-20 listings and wallet integrations. 'Frenzy' is possibly even an understatement- OKX’s NFT marketplace has now passed Blur in total sales on its ordinals volume alone. And despite all this, Western markets have barely even begun to pick up on the narrative, hinting at how early it likely still is.\n\nBeing bullish on all things Bitcoin, I think the obvious next step is still for Bitcoin L2s to see price discovery as people accept that scaling solutions will become a key part of the Bitcoin ecosystem's future. It’s highly possible that this could lead to an entire price re-rating as people realize that the leading Bitcoin L2s should have multi-billion dollar valuations. With the alt L1 thesis largely played out the last few weeks, a Bitcoin rotation on the back of the ETF, halving, and Ordinals logically makes sense.\n\nAlongside an obvious core BTC spot long, I continue to favor Stacks as a likely contender to lead the L2 battle, and think certain exchange listed BRC-20 tokens can continue to squeeze hard as western markets pick up the trend."

So if users are using apps across 10 different chains, the user must maintain 10 different accounts which is tedious and unpleasant. Users would much rather limit their interaction to a few chains.\n\nWithout a solution for account fragmentation, apps also are likely to aggregate around a handful of chains, based on community metrics like # of active users, etc. Even if a new chain or building an appchain is more optimized for their needs, the fear of an empty room is too daunting.\n\nTo thrive, single-chain apps need solutions that enable them to access to users on other chains and streamline user interactions. Essentially, solutions addressing the account fragmentation problem. 🧩\n\nThat is our goal at Orb labs.

Also, possible we see high volatility in the asset (SOL) relative to others that have strong consistent performance (ETH). You could even take this a step further and look at how NVDA materially outperformed AMD over this run up due to better software (CUDA) and thus performance, but worst cost structures.\n\nThis framing is a little overly bullish imo but it's interesting.\n\n--\n\nTSLA as a corollary for SOL may actually be the best one though if we think about market structures and how major participants look at an asset moving from an \"alt\" to a \"blue chip\" within their category, all while defying fundamental analysis for a long period of time, but capturing large narrative value and technology premium along the way. You could even say the disruption of Monolithic vs. Modular is similar to EV vs. Combustion engine.\n\nThis isn't the right asset framing entirely from a broader industry returns perspective though as auto OEMs largely have underperformed, however if you put TSLA in context of FAANG, then perhaps this is a stronger argument.\n\nAnyways, just some half-baked thoughts while sitting at the airport.\n\nCharts here (note differing time scales):"

Halo was doing trans-cranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in a pair of headphones to try and improve athletic performance before Flow acquired them. \n\nThis research has been going on in labs for 15-20 years in earnest, and tDCS goes back over 100 years. But we seem to be at an inflection point where it's coming out of the lab and into the world. \n\nObviously there are limitations to what's possible. But imagine a device that could treat depression, or help you focus, or make you less anxious and more happy, without any drugs involved. With the right instruments you can target and stimulate millimeter sized regions of the brain. A lot is going to be possible without invasive brain surgery and things like Neuralink"

            "full_text": "Collateralized debt positions (CDPs) and Lending protocols have increased capital efficiency for DeFi natives and provided the means for profitable strategies. \n\nHowever, they are not without their own shortcomings.\n\nThe reliance on smart contracts introduces vulnerability to potential bugs and external attacks, posing inherent risks to the security and stability of CDPs. \n\nThis is why the code @AureliusFi [the Ethos reserve code base] has been audited multiple times over, and checks put in place. \n\nIn 2022, about $4B in DeFi investor’s funds were stolen by hackers. Attacks of this scales pose a significant threat, particularly to CDPs and lending protocols as economic pitfalls that occur as a result of hacks can lead to death spirals and the potential collapse of products.\n\nBelow are some of the hacks and bugs that were recorded in the CDP and lending space this year:\n\n1) Euler Finance hack (April, 2023)\n\nThe eToken.sol contract permitted the generation of an unlimited quantity of tokens for any collateral value, resulting in a simultaneous increase in debt tokens (dToken). This allowed users to amass as much collateral as desired while expanding their debt. Additionally, the protocol facilitated the contribution of assets to the market reserve through the eToken's donateToReserves function.\n\nThe issue arose from the absence of a health ratio check in this function. This lapse, combined with the capability to accumulate collateral, introduced the potential for liquidating a position with substantial profit.\n\n2) ParaSpace hack (March, 2023)\n\nParaSpace is a lending protocol where users can use NFTs from top collections like BAYC as collateral. The protocol also allowed the use of APE tokens to collateralize positions, which were initially staked on the official Yuga Labs contract from the protocol's contract address.\n\nInstead of getting APE tokens, users received cAPE tokens, and the cAPE balance was determined by the user's share from the ParaSpace staking pool multiplied by the total APE tokens locked by the protocol.\n\nThe problem in the system was that the total APE tokens staked by the protocol could be manipulated. This happened because the APE staking contract from Yuga Labs permitted deposits from any address to any address.\n\nBy exploiting a flashloan, the attacker manipulated the total number of APE tokens locked in the protocol, consequently altering their cAPE balance.\n\n3) Tigris Trade Audit (December, 2022)\n\nTigris Trade enabled users to put in one stablecoin as collateral and take out another. However, there was an issue found by the auditor. In this instance, a user could deposit a stablecoin worth 0.95 USD (not pegged properly) and withdraw a stablecoin worth a full 1 USD (properly pegged).\n\nThis would cause the protocol to lose 0.05 USD for each token.\n\n4) Astaria Audit (October, 2022)\n\nDuring the liquidation auction, bids were accepted in the form of token transfers to a contract. If one person's bidding interrupted someone else's bid, the initial bidder was supposed to get their money back. Unfortunately, a problem was found in the cancelAuction() function. This bug caused the last bid not to be returned to the original bidder, leading to the funds getting stuck in the contract.\n\nThese are a few cases where  vulnerabilities were exploited and few where they were prevented (audit cases).\n\nThese events serve as a chilling reminder that money markets are not perfect yet and hence carry a certain level of inherent risk, one you should be familiar with.\n\nWith our multiple audits, and checks in place, we seek to provide you a safe and secure experience. Coming soon to Mantle."

Then Photoshop came in and changed the paradigm to image editing: old schoolers laughed at it because its pixel tools were so weak, but there was magic in changing the conceptual focus to the image and often editing it at a much higher resolution than the display. I’ve come to recognize generative AI art as the next paradigm change, away from drawing the image, towards specifying a scene through a combination of prompts, infills, and hand edits - whatever gets to the best result fastest. Fine Photoshop artists lament it (and shady IP practices warrant their respective criticisms) but ultimately it’s a new tool with a new paradigm that will likely become the predominant one in the future.\n\nAnd though the current tools are all about images, they’re rapidly evolving into video and 3D scenes, the ultimate version of which may be full 3D scene and animated shot synthesis and tweaking at professional levels of quality. For those born after the birth of the personal computer and the internet, it’ll be one’s first contact with a complete technological upheaval.\n\nThe rapid burst of progress over the past 18 months in chat and art may be a bit misleading though, as they were preceded by 3 decades of directly applicable foundational research. Some areas of future AI application are lacking in these foundations, so we can expect progress to come in fits and starts. But the exponential upward trend is unmistakable."

However, they also pose many significant risks such as the presence of biased, private, or harmful text, and the unauthorized inclusion of copyrighted material. We introduce h2oGPT, a suite of open-source code repositories for the creation and use of Large Language Models (LLMs) based on Generative Pretrained Transformers (GPTs). The goal of this project is to create the world's best truly open-source alternative to closed-source GPTs. In collaboration with and as part of the incredible and unstoppable open-source community, we open-source several fine-tuned h2oGPT models from 7 to 40 Billion parameters, ready for commercial use under fully permissive Apache 2.0 licenses. Included in our release is 100% private document search using natural language. Open-source language models help boost AI development and make it more accessible and trustworthy. They lower entry hurdles, allowing people and groups to tailor these models to their needs. This openness increases innovation, transparency, and fairness."

Happy birthday Transformer! 🎂\n\nFun facts:\n- Transformer did not invent attention, but pushed it to the extreme. The first attention paper was published 3 years prior (2014) and had an unassuming title: \"Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate\", from Yoshua Bengio's lab. \nIt is a combination of RNN + \"context vectors\" (i.e. attention). Many of you likely haven't heard about this paper, but it's one of the greatest milestones in NLP and has been cited 29K times (compared to Transformer's 77K).\n\n- Neither Transformer nor the original attention paper talked about the general-purpose sequence computer. Instead, both were conceived as solutions to one narrow & specific problem: machine translation. It's remarkable that AGI (some day soon) can trace its origin to the humble Google Translate. 😅\n\n- Transformer was published at NeurIPS 2017, one of the top AI conferences worldwide. Yet it didn't even get an Oral presentation, let alone awards. There were 3 best papers at NeurIPS that year. Combined, they have 529 citations as of today."

They cannot understand it\n\nJobs was both one of the most egotistical people in the world and one of it's greatest ever entrepreneurs\n\nHis ego created the delusional self-belief necessary to achieve greatness. He tricked himself into believing he could achieve 100x more than he was capable of, and it worked. \n\nTo tell him to kill this ego would have been to kill the very thing that made him Jobs\n\nAnd those who couldn't stand his outbursts believed this was a fault of his own emotional regulation. They were wrong. It was their own fault of not being able to recognize a legend when one was standing right in front of them. They became upset because they felt they had some sort of part to play in the story - that they were somehow on equal playing ground. Again, they were wrong. Nobody remembers the names of these people\n\nThese people believe that somehow the egotist is making a mistake. That they will come to regret their behavior. Again, they are wrong. They do not understand the brilliant mind - the only thing it is interested in is the one thing it can see: greatness\n\nMany of Michael Jordan's teammates hated him too.\n\nBut not once has Jobs or Jordan ever gone on the record to say that their goal was to make friends - to make those around them feel comfortable and wanted\n\nYou can get with the program, or you can get out\n\nRemember that Kings are not painted with smiles\n\nYou can be brilliant with a few friends\n\nOr you can be kind and nice and not offend anybody with a few more friends\n\nBut the worst thing you can do is deny your proclivities because you think it will make the people around you more comfortable because they will not be forced to contend with your brilliance\n\nThe only thing this will do is kill your spirit. And then they will forget your brilliance, and they will assert themselves on top of you\n\nNobody who tells you to kill your ego has your best interests at heart\n\nYour hatred is what makes you strong.

I can’t help but think this is because they themselves are tribal - they want to protect their bags (“first-ever”) and part of that is not letting anything on BTC win.\n\nI say this only because I’m yet to hear a strong argument against The Nakamoto as one of, if not *the* most important artwork on the blockchain.\n\nSo, it’s great to see a leader of the new wave of digital collectibles unabashedly picking up this grail. \n\nDISCLAIMER: We own a Naka at @ReidarDAO (for over a year now)."

We recommend waiting 24 hours until using the Ledger Connect Kit again.\n\nThe investigation continues, here is the timeline of what we know about the exploit at this moment:\n\n- This morning CET, a former Ledger Employee fell victim to a phishing attack that gained access to their NPMJS account.\n- The attacker published a malicious version of the Ledger Connect Kit (affecting versions 1.1.5, 1.1.6, and 1.1.7). The malicious code used a rogue WalletConnect project to reroute funds to a hacker wallet.\n- Ledger’s technology and security teams were alerted and a fix was deployed within 40 minutes of Ledger becoming aware. The malicious file was live for around 5 hours, however we believe the window where funds were drained was limited to a period of less than two hours.\n- Ledger coordinated with @WalletConnect who quickly disabled the the rogue project.\n- The genuine and verified Ledger Connect Kit version 1.1.8 is now propagating and is safe to use.\n- For builders who are developing and interacting with the Ledger Connect Kit code: connect-kit development team  on the NPM project are now read-only and can’t directly push the NPM package for safety reasons.\n- We have internally rotated the secrets to publish on Ledger’s GitHub.\n- Developers, please check again that you’re using the latest version, 1.1.8.\n- Ledger, along with @Walletconnect and our partners, have reported the bad actor’s wallet address. The address is now visible on @chainalysis. @Tether_to has frozen the bad actor’s USDT.\n- We remind you to always Clear Sign with your Ledger. What you see on the Ledger screen is what you actually sign. If you still need to blind sign, use an additional Ledger mint wallet or parse your transaction manually.\n- We are actively talking with customers whose funds might have been affected, and working proactively to help those individuals at this time.\n- We are filing a complaint and working with law enforcement on the investigation to find the attacker.\n- We’re studying the exploit in order to avoid further attacks. We believe the attacker’s address where the funds were drained is here: 0x658729879fca881d9526480b82ae00efc54b5c2d\n\nThank you to @WalletConnect, @Tether_io, @Chainalysis, @zachxbt, and the whole community that helped us and continue to help us identify and solve this attack. \n\nSecurity will always prevail with the help of the whole ecosystem."

This is an ongoing situation and it is risky to use dapps currently if you don't understand what backend libraries they use.\n\nHow does this drain your money?\n\nIf you visit the website you won't get automatically drained or your funds. However, prompts from your browser wallet (like MM) will display that give your assets to the malicious actors.\n\nDoes Ledger know about this?\n\nYes they do and are working on it.\n\nNote: Even after Ledger corrects the bad code in their library, projects using and deploying that library will need to update things before it is safe to use dapps that use Ledger's web3 libraries.\n\nDisclaimer: This is my own opinion and not the opinion of any of my employers.

And so I think you should be prepared to change your mind often. \n\nBut in school and most other places they don't emphasize this enough. As if it's some heroic act and higher moral ground sticking to your original thesis. \n\nBut when you think about it, it's ridiculous to assume you'll get it right at the beginning stages of forming a thesis. You should be changing your mind more often than not as you do more work!\n\nAs I sit here today, likely biased by the price action, but processing months of more work I am adjusting my 20% probability that SOL flips ETH. That was Dec 1, 2023 when I came out with that prediction in the episode on @theempirepod. SOL was at $60.\n\nThat math assumed 20% * $250B ETH FDMC (on Dec 1) = $50B SOL FDMC = $88 / SOL\n\nSOL is at $123 now.\n\nAt the time it felt right as I said it would happen this cycle (probabilities without timing are useless) but I now I don't see a reason why Solana can't be at parity with Ethereum and eventually overtake it.  Timing, as always, is tricky...\n\nI'm updating my probability to 80% that Solana converges on Ethereum's market cap this cycle (within ~3 years). Why not 100%? \n\nWell because nothing is 100% but mindful that SOL is a younger network. Although things in tech and markets are not linear or slow once they start working. \n\nBut also because I also think ETH's market cap expands during this time, and so aggregate flows in crypto may be a bottleneck. \n\nAlthough this also assumes rotation within crypto to be more SOL centric. But that is marginal. I think most of the outperformance of SOL and gap closing will be a higher share of new inflows going to SOL relative to other networks. But in crypto correlation is still high so higher SOL also likely means higher ETH and other assets (see price action of AVAX outperforming SOL in last few weeks FWIW)...\n\nBut enough with the rant. Uncle duties call so I need to go back to opening presents with little kids. Here's the TLDR and updated math:\n\nI don't see a reason why Solana can't be at parity with Ethereum and eventually overtake it. But pegging probability of that happening this cycle at 80%:\n\n80% * 275B ETH FDMC = $220B SOL FDMC = $400 / SOL \n \n* FDMC and price likely expand for both ETH and SOL, as inflows growth and overall crypto mkt cap grows (high correlation within crypto persists this cycle). So most important thing is the ratio of SOL/ETH and that converging so that FDMC = 1:1"

While 2 DEXes in fact saw their volume decline from January to November (Curve and Dodo), only Pancakeswap was able to more than double their January volume. THORChain, meanwhile, increased volume by almost 9x!\n\nNow of course this is partly because THORChain had a lower starting volume, but it still highlights the immense progress the protocol has made over the past 12 months.\n\nAs a result of this huge volume increase, @THORChain has been gobbling up market share from its DEX competitors at an incredible rate. A report from Coingecko found that, as of June 2023, THORChain processed 0.8% of all DEX volume.\n\nIf THORChain is able to keep capturing market share at this rate, it will overtake Pancakeswap as the number 2 DEX in no time. And while Uniswap is still comfortably ahead right now, THORChain is starting to close the gap quite quickly. $RUNE"

I think this can be our mark on the onchain perp space. \n \nIronically in late 2021 (when we got together) nobody wanted to use onchain perps. The bull market was in full force and CEX founders were still CT’s main characters. \n \nBut eventually CEXs fell from grace and with that onchain perps began to see some adoption. It started with @GMX_IO showing that you could build a big perp business with a bunch of ETH liquidity and a couple thousand traders. It turns out opening up 7/8 figure trades in a single transaction was great PMF. \n \nAround the same time, @GainsNetwork_io and @synthetix_io extended the oracle perps to more assets like forex and other top cryptos. And soon after that, @HyperliquidX + @aevoxyz brought on long tail assets using orderbooks on their custom AppChains.\n\nFast forward to today, onchain perps have clear PMF but are still < 2% the size of CEX perps. Imo there are a couple things holding us back:\n\n- Many diff perps/L2s/Appchains\n- Each avenue has its own listings\n- Liquidity is fragmented\n- UX doesn’t rival CEXs\n\nThese are the problems we set out to solve with v2. In simple terms, we aggregate all perps across all chains in one place, give you best price/funding execution, handle bridging for you behind the scenes, and use account abstraction to make trading feel like a CEX. \n \nThere is more, but I’ll save that for another tweet. In the meanwhile, join discord and get an invite to start trading!"

            "full_text": "$NULL \n\nThis invention surpasses $ZERO in greatness. It's easier to standardize, more equitable, and fully on-chain. Let me explain:\n\nFirst, the draw's randomness comes from future block data, using the third block's hash and the fourth block's difficulty data for random number generation, with the draw occurring in the fifth block. Since no one can predict the data of future blocks yet to be produced, this ingeniously solves the problem of generating true randomness on-chain.\n\nAnother intriguing feature is the Lucky Ticket. Unlike $ZERO, the number of tickets per block isn't fixed at one, but varies between 1-6. A block can produce up to six tickets. So, if there's only one participant in the current block, they could sweep the entire prize pool. I prefer to call it the 'Explosive Block'.\"\n\nIt represents a genuinely viable approach to standardizing fair launch asset distribution, marking yet another remarkable social experiment."

            "full_text": "2024 is going to be the most important year for DeFi.\n\nMy DeFi journey started 7 years ago when I became passionate about the idea of democratizing finance. Ethereum enabled a platform where financial enthusiasts like me could build open, accessible, and transparent financial infrastructure by reducing the need for centralized middlemen.\n\nMy first thought was that building on a public blockchain network would enable new programmable financial apps that would otherwise be difficult to build in traditional finance, especially when it comes to app-to-app composability. The barrier to innovation was ridiculously low. Build, compose, and deploy.\n\nStakes are higher. When we built the Aave Protocol V1 in January 2020, the whole DeFi TVL was sitting at $600M. A year later, Aave Protocol V1 TVL peaked at $2.6B, and our team already launched V2, which later in 2021 had a peak TVL sitting at nearly $20B.\n\nUnlike many other DeFi Protocols, the Aave Protocol collects revenue directly into the DAO Treasury, which, in a decentralized fashion by governance voting, reimburses community members to finance development, smart contract security work, governance work, treasury management, risk management, and even infamous rAAVEs and other community events. Anyone can come to the DAO and create a proposal. What are the chances for an ordinary person to successfully suggest a proposal to a central bank or credit card network to change the way they operate? I reckon close to none.\n\nAs boring or as painful DAOs can be, they can actually be the right tool to govern an infrastructure that should be neutral and global.\n\nBack to the fees. The Aave DAO is a net-positive DAO, meaning that after costs, it has enough revenue to leave a surplus. It's not a business; it's more akin to using democracy to govern a vital public infrastructure (this is how the internet would be governed if crypto-economics existed back then).\n\nBased on the fees some of the DeFi Protocols are earning and the usage, we can strongly argue that DeFi has Protocol-Market Fit. It's the only category that has PMF in web3.\n\nOver the past couple of years, it became more clear that L2 Rollups (and subnets, etc.) might be the way to scale blockspace. Since blockchain enables financialization and monetization, these rollups would all need to figure out a financial layer to serve whatever use-case they are seeking after (i.e., web3 social, regen, or gaming). I like to draw an analogy for rollups as Towns, and each Town needs its own non-custodial bank.\n\nThe Aave community recognized early the demand for liquidity across networks. For that reason, the Aave Protocol is deployed over multiple networks, and most likely we will see additional networks during 2024. I also believe that smart and resourceful DeFi communities will seek new market share from non-EVM networks.\n\nI've never been as excited about DeFi as I am today. Mainly because today we have DeFi protocols that have reached PMF, are enabling financial layers across various networks (Ethereum, L2s such as Optimism, Arbitrum, Scroll, Metis, and ZkSync, Avalanche, and Polygon), and are truly decentralized or progressing towards decentralization. DeFi used to crawl; now it's walking and from now on is preparing for a run.\n\nEspecially lower transaction fees would give DeFi a fair shot at building payment infrastructure and bring web3 closer to consumer usage. This vision is part of what GHO could be, bringing web3 payments into mainstream.\n\nWhile there are DeFi Protocols that are moving towards the growth stage, there are plenty of challenges ahead that the whole community has an opportunity to work on.\n\nHere are a few:\n\n- Ungovernance, less governance where it's not needed\n- Bringing meritocracy into DeFi governance to diversify one token one vote mechanism\n- Stay sufficiently decentralized (DAOs need to be factually decentralized. A great test is whether the protocol would function if the founding team would move on)\n- Risk management tooling improvements\n- Smart Contract security tools are still non-existent\n- Moving seamlessly and securely liquidity around multiple networks\n- L2s can have more liquidity when they stop acting like databases and have better fault tolerance against a single point of failures (taking off the training wheels)\n\nFor the Aave ecosystem, during 2024, I will be expecting more new innovation. There is so much innovation that can be done on liquidity markets and decentralized stablecoins and other areas the Aave community should look into. I am also even more excited to see new participants in the Aave governance.\n\nFor the whole DeFi community, I wish you a successful 2024 and want to remind you that you are contributing to building a better, accessible financial system; you are all heroes in this journey.\n\nWishing all you degens an amazing 2024! 👻\n\nPosted first on @t2wrld (@LensProtocol powered blogging app):  https://t.co/VqEUACShWY"

            "full_text": "The most undervalued project in the whole space right now is about to make big moves.\n\nSmart money is already accumulating, and a big campaign is starting now by the time of writing!\n\nDon’t miss this chance, and keep on reading; it could literally change your lives. 🧵👇\n\nFirst, let me start with the news that $PRANA, the up-and-coming Token of the Yogapetz project, is changing its name to $WELL.\n\nIf you ask yourself now why would they do that, it has good reasoning behind it, which is for the greater good of the success of the Token👇\n\n@keungz weeks right now are fully packed with meetings of strategic partners, investors, CEXs & numerous VCs, and they all thought that PRANA is hard to explain to the masses, and since we are a Wellness project that wants to reach the mass markets, a simple name would be the best.\n\nSo $WELL was the best choice. It’s just a name rebranding, by the way.\n\n$Well is a Token that will revolutionize the huge wellness industry and make it fun for everyone to participate in wellness activities.\n\nSpoiler: (I got something for you guys at the end)\n\nHow are they gonna achieve it? They have been building an app with the best developer app Team in Hong Kong (Green Tomato), which is almost finished. The name of the app is Well3.\n\nWell3 stands for Wellness 3.0. It’s a Wellness app powered with AI technology. It combines two huge fields. AI + Wellness.\n\nThat is a trillion-dollar field, guys. Imagine it going to the masses, which I’m confident it will. Top-notch developers build the app. The best VCs are on board, like Newman Capital, etc., and so on.\n\nI see Yogapetz and $WELL to set a whole new trend with the things you can do on the app.\n\nFor example:\n- Breathe to earn\n- Sleep to earn\n\nJust to name two of them. You remember STEPN with its 'walk to earn.' It was huge.\n\nNow imagine what waves 'Breathe to earn' and 'Sleep to earn' could make. That will incentivize a whole lot of traditional Web2 people who aren’t even in Wellness to start their wellness journey.\n\nThe even better thing is, you don’t even need to be into wellness to participate in the Well3 activities. Because the tasks you can do there are universal things which all of us are doing.\n\nThe potential is so massive it’s making me more bullish every time I think about it.\n\nWe are all talking about bridging Web2 people to Web3, and everyone is trying to achieve that.\n\nhttps://t.co/tGg7SU9ncw\n\nYogapetz, the $WELL token, and the Well3 app could be the answer to that!\n\nThe prices we are seeing right now are laughable for the things that are cooking. Especially because Yogapetz and Keungz holders are the first ones to get their hands on the Token which will revolutionize a huge industry with $WELL.\n\nMultiple MVPs from Memeland are forming their SuperKrews in the Keungz ecosystem now, and are buying Yogapetz, because they see a similar path to success for $WELL as with $MEME.\nOne more thing. $MEME was a huge success. That had numerous reasons, but the biggest is probably in monetary terms that it was listed on Binance right away.\n\nMany thought Grapes would follow the same path, but they unfortunately didn’t.\n\nGrapes still did good, but they didn’t have the 'game-changer,' and that is Binance.\n\nIf a Token launches on Binance it is set for an astronomical rise. Simply because the buy pressure there can match the potential sell pressure from some of the AirDrop people in our cases.\n\nI can just say this. Keungz is aware why Grapes didn’t manage to get listed on Binance, and he is working on it already.\n\nTo get listed on Binance you need a couple of things, but the most important is: You need to bring as many people as possible. Binance wants users and therefore you need a product that attracts many users.\n\nWell, there comes the app Well3 into play. Keungz plays chess guys.\n\n\"I started to write this Thread yesterday and the farming campaign is now up for 24 hours and there are already over 30.000k users!\" Thats insane. \n\nThere is one more thing that can benefit a potential Binance listing, and this is Binance new chain 'OPBNB' which, by the way, will be used for the on-chain quests on the Well3 app🌝\n\nConnect the dots, guys. Everything is planned. Keungz is a genius; he knows exactly what he is doing.\n\nEarlier I talked about a campaign which starts now, and that is the farming campaign.\n\nEven if you don’t hold Yogapetz or Keungz Assets you can still earn $Well tokens through farming.\n\nThe farming could be highly profitable for the farmers, so I encourage everyone to participate in it even if you already hold a lot of Yogapetz NFTs.\n\nThe farming quests are really fun and fast and easy to do, like breathing for one minute. It’s all wellness-related.\n\nTo start your farming journey you need a referral code. I will share a couple of them at the end of the Thread.\n\nIf you want free $well airdrop, just daily do these:\n\n1. Compete daily missions to level up\n2. Invite friends to earn extra exp\n3. Alpha: Enter the Master Quests everyday\n\nI'm sharing 7 exclusive invite codes to join https://t.co/7e2tDJvnrA 🎉 Have fun with the codes and the farming guys, its gonna be so worth it.\n\nRTQJV\nRH87D\nBDXEH\n68S6D\n53BDR\n68S6D\n53BDR"

I made mistakes, and I must take responsibility. This is best for our community, for Binance, and for myself.\n\nBinance is no longer a baby. It is time for me to let it walk and run. I know Binance will continue to grow and excel with the deep bench it has.\n\nI’m pleased to announce that @_RichardTeng, our now former Global Head of Regional Markets, has been named the new CEO of Binance today.\n\nRichard is a highly qualified leader and, with over three decades of financial services and regulatory experience, he will navigate the company through its next period of growth. He will ensure Binance delivers on our next phase of security, transparency, compliance, and growth.\n\nPrior to joining Binance, Richard was CEO of the Financial Services Regulatory Authority at Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM); Chief Regulatory Officer of the Singapore Exchange (SGX); and Director of Corporate Finance in the Monetary Authority of Singapore.\n\nWith Richard and the entire team, I’m confident that the best days for @Binance and the crypto industry lay ahead.\n\nAs a shareholder and former CEO with historical knowledge of our company, I will remain available to the team to consult as needed, consistent with the framework set out in our U.S. agency resolutions.\n\nWhat’s next for me?\n\nI will take a break first. I have not had a single day of real (phone off) break for the last 6 and half years.\n\nAfter that, my current thinking is I will probably do some passive investing, being a minority token/shareholder in startups in areas of blockchain/Web3/DeFi, AI and biotech. I am happy that I will finally have more time to spend looking at DeFi.\n\nI can’t see myself being a CEO driving a startup again. I am content being an one-shot (lucky) entrepreneur. Should there be listeners, I may be open to being a coach/mentor to a small number of upcoming entrepreneurs, privately. If for nothing else, I can at least tell them what not to do.\n\nOn that note, I am proud to point out that in our resolutions with the U.S. agencies they:\n\n- do not allege that Binance misappropriated any user funds, and\n- do not allege that Binance engaged in any market manipulation.\n\nFunds are SAFU!\n\nWith that, I look forward to seeing the new leadership take the reins. Please join me in congratulating Richard on his well-deserved promotion.\n\nOnwards!\n\nCZ"

Compare this to Alchemy and Infura which are estimated at 20-30b and 6-8B respectively. Alchemy and Infura have market valuations estimated to be $5 billion+. Node infrastructure will be one of the key categories of allocation.\n\nOne of the reasons why $POKT burn/usage has been growing so much is because it has now become cheaper than most other providers. Many big names in this space like TraderJoe, WalletConnect, Trust wallet have started to switch and there are many more big names coming.\n\nReally an undervalued gem"

            "full_text": "从半同质化资产角度看铭文\n\n昨天在 Wamo 清迈 Builder Day 的分享会上聊了一下铭文，《从半同质化资产角度看铭文》。\n\n铭文从技术上来看，简单粗暴，技术人第一次看了应该都是那个问号表情，这什么玩意？\n\n不过经过这些天在智能合约中解析铭文的经历，总结了一下，它其实可以理解成一种半同质化资产（SFT）。\n\n本来 Ordinals Inscription 可以理解成一种 NFT 的表达，有一个唯一 ID，包含了 content_type 以及 content，可以嵌入任何数据类型。而 BRC20 协议把 JSON 嵌入到 content 中，定义了 FT。FT 在 NFT 中，其实就是一种典型的 SFT 的表达方式，大家买卖铭文也习惯用“张”来作为单位。\n\n而 SFT 有什么使用场景呢？这个其实上一次 DeFi 时候大家都有过深入的研究。比如用来表达游戏道具，中间的 FT 的 value 可以表达稀缺度，还比如用来表达债券，优惠券，各种票据等。但上个周期它的特性并没有充分发挥出来，也没有很多 SFT 类型的资产被创造出来。而现在铭文的火爆，让这种类型的资产被充分创造出来了，如何利用它们呢？\n\n当前铭文的扩展性困境\n\n如果要发挥出铭文作为 SFT 的优势，必须给它创造出使用场景，就必须扩展铭文协议。已经有一些团队尝试通过扩充铭文协议，比如 BRC20 中增加更多的 op 指令来实现。但一个铭文协议一旦被市场广泛接受，必然有多家索引器的实现，要扩展协议必须要多个索引器在链下达成共识，实现共识升级，这个升级的难度不低于 L1 的共识升级，显然很难满足扩展性的需求。\n\n而针对这种扩展性要求，业界其实已经摸索出了一套成熟的方案，那就是智能合约。区块链的智能合约虚拟机模式，是整个软件工程界摸索出来的最具有扩展性的模式。所以现在的方案有两种：1. 在索引器中引入智能合约。2. 通过智能合约来表达铭文。\n\n索引器中引入智能合约\n\n索引器中引入智能合约，可以叫做智能索引器，或者模块化区块链中的执行层。铭文的模式可以把它理解成 DA first 的 sovereign Rollup，它把 L1 作为 DA，也没有引入 排序器（Sequencer），直接通过 L1 的区块来进行交易排序，而索引器也自然可以理解成执行层。这种模式我在文章《铭文是个 Bug 还是 Feature？https://t.co/ePavTpb03C 中有过阐述。 而 Rooch 也在这个方向进行探索，具体方案参看 《Bitcoin 的 Layer2 应该怎么做？》https://t.co/MV0L0VExSy 。\n\n我们正在构建一个这种场景的示例游戏，叫做 Bitcoin Plants。由于 Rooch 中有全量的 Bitcoin 状态，智能合约中可以读取到 Ordinals 的 Inscription，用户可以在游戏中把某个 Inscription 作为种子，种出一颗植物，这个植物需要用户定期浇水灌溉，然后它可以结出果实。而这个植物是绑定到 Inscription 上的，如果用户把 Bitcoin 上的 Inscription 转让，这个植物也会被转让。这个简单的例子展示了如何通过执行层的智能合约来给 L1 的铭文创造使用场景。详情参看 github issue https://t.co/qGkRkiLhZU 。\n\n另外，也看到 Ethscriptions 在构建 facet 虚拟机，也是类似的路线，看来业界朋友也都看到了这个方向。\n\n通过智能合约来表达铭文\n\n如果说 Bitcoin 上的是因为没有智能合约，所以开发者琢磨出了铭刻 JSON 的方法。而其他智能合约链上为啥还依然是写 JSON 呢？最不能理解的是 Rollup L2 上写 JSON，那个 JSON 最终还是会 Rollup 到 L1，那为啥去 L2 写呢？L2 不应该自然变成 L1 铭文的索引器吗？自己还需要个铭文索引器？但即便是这样，也挡不住用户玩铭文的热情，很多 L2 都被玩挂了。所以思来想去，我总结了铭文的几个启示：\n\n1. 它是一种半同质化资产，它的流动性并不如 FT，但这在市场起步阶段是优势。\n2. 它发行资产的门槛比各链上的 FT 都要低，认知成本也低。各链上发行资产一般都需要部署个智能合约，识别也主要是通过合约地址，而这对新手来说比较困难。而铭文这波把这个门槛基本降到了最低。\n3. 它的公平发行模式，Bitcoin 上可以理解成通过 Gas 租赁矿工矿机的 PoW 发行模式。\n\n那既然这样，我们为什么不用智能合约来实现一个铭文协议，并且兼具以上特性呢？于是这周我尝试用 Move 实现了一个 Movescriptions 协议。\n\n首先，它是一种通过 Move 表达的半同质化资产协议。Move 基于数据结构的资产表达方式，非常适合表达这种协议。\n\n1. 通过 tick 这个全局唯一的名字来表达类型，借鉴 BRC20，符合 KISS 原则，简单直观。\n2. value 可以用来表达 FT 的余额，或者 NFT 里面的关键值。\n3. Metadata 可以附加任意类型的数据。\n\n其次，它支持通过 PoW 来分发资产。部署者可以通过指定 difficulty 来设置一个难度，保证资产的分发更公平，更分散。因为其他链的 Gas 太低，很难实现通过烧 Gas 来防女巫攻击。\n\n而这样通过智能合约实现的铭文，我称之为智能铭文，铭文终于要进化到需要智能合约的时候了😂。 这样的铭刻出来的铭文自然就是智能合约的状态，也不依赖索引器，很容易和各种应用场景进行组合，比如 FOCG。对这个试验感兴趣的朋友可以关注 @movescription ，以及 github https://t.co/UOXl5Vl7Iw 。当前 Rooch 版本的合约已经初步完成，PoW 分发也已经实现，其他 Move 链的版本正在进行中。\n\n铭文的对开发者的启示\n\n铭文始发于 Bitcoin 的上的随机尝试，如今席卷各公链，它虽然简单粗暴，但极具生命力。它的未来还不明朗，看待它的分歧也很大，但这也是市场有趣的地方，机会总是在产生分歧的地方。那让我们就给它再添加一些随机性吧，开发者们可以行动起来，与其让用户铭刻一堆不知道怎么用的 JSON，不如试试看能不能把它和智能合约结合起来。如果结合成功，它可能是 FOGC 以及 AW 的启动的点火石，这个我们可以下篇再聊。"

            "full_text": "首先要澄清一个概念BRC100是一个协议的名称，正如BRC20一样，上面可以部署任意名称的铭文，BRC100协议的龙头叫做BRC100；\n数量：2100万，已经属于全流通；\n购买地址：https://t.co/fF69gdyxkF\nBRC-100基于序数理论，提出了一种模块化的协议和应用方法：继承和嵌套。这为BRC-100协议和应用的扩展提供了理论基础。它本质上描述了一个具有计算能力和状态的代币，这种代币的行为是BRC-20协议的扩展。BRC-100基于两种模型：UTXO模型和状态机模型，这极大地扩展了比特币的计算能力。代币操作符合UTXO模型，而计算符合状态机模型。BRC-100还引入了新的操作：burn2/burn3和mint2/mint3，使得代币可以在UTXO模型和状态机模型之间安全转换。用简单一点的话来理解就是：BRC100协议属于BRC20协议的升级版，涵盖更多的功能\n本节重点讲解一下BRC100协议与BRC20协议的不一样之处。BRC20协议发的铭文具备token与NFT二相性，BRC20发币的时候只有一个mint动作，任何人都可以mint，直到完全mint完后就成全流通状态，可以实现转账功能。BRC20实现了一种全新的资产发行方式，但是也仅仅只是发行了资产，资产全流通后除了可以转账外并没有其他功能。缺乏像以太坊那样的智能合约功能可能会给一些项目带来困恼，不能实现代币回购、销毁、锁定等等功能。BRC100正是为了解决这些问题而诞生，虽然不足以媲美以太坊的智能合约，但是也发展了除了转账外的许多功能。下面是BRC100协议已经实现了的升级的部分\nBRC-100协议提供了三种铸币操作符：mint、mint2和mint3，用于在不同场景中铸造代币。在部署应用程序时，需要设置公众可铸造的代币数量。剩余的代币将使用操作符：\"mint\"来铸造。\nmint：公共铸币，任何人都可以向用户铸造代币，但通过\"mint\"操作符铸造的代币总量不能超过应用程序的最大设置。铸造后，代币的流通供应量将增加。\nmint2：白名单铸币，应用程序记录可以铸币的用户或应用程序数量，任何人都可以根据应用程序规则向用户或应用程序铸造mint2代币。铸造mint2后，代币的流通供应量也将增加。\nmint3：状态铸币，mint3在其他应用程序中铸造用户或应用程序的余额，任何人都可以根据应用程序规则向用户或应用程序铸造mint3代币。铸造mint3后，代币的流通供应量不会增加。\n2）burn\n销毁是BRC-100协议新引入的操作。用户可以刻录销毁操作的铭文，然后将铭文转移给应用程序的部署者，这与转账操作的语义相似。然后，被刻录的代币将被销毁或转移到应用程序的余额中。与铸造操作的定义类似，有三种销毁操作符：burn、burn2和burn3，分别对应于mint、mint2和mint3。所有应用程序/代币都支持这三种销毁操作符，无需额外配置。\nburn：公共销毁，任何人都可以使用操作符销毁代币。代币成功销毁后，流通供应量将减少，且销毁的代币不能再次铸造。\nburn2：白名单销毁，根据应用程序预设规则，向应用程序销毁burn2代币后，用户的余额将减少，应用程序的状态也将相应更新，流通供应量将减少。在实践中，例如在AMM DEX中移除流动性的逻辑可以通过burn2实现。\nburn3：状态销毁，burn3将减少用户的代币余额，并增加\"to\"应用程序的余额。在实践中，它可以与mint3一起使用，以完成AMM DEX中的代币交换、添加流动性等逻辑。\n3）交易税和通货紧缩\nBRC-100协议引入了一种新的代币交易机制：交易税和通货紧缩。应用程序可以设定交易税比例、税收接收者和交易黑洞百分比。这些设置仅在基于AMM的去中心化交易所中交易时生效。普通的转账、铸造和销毁操作不会触发交易税和通货紧缩。\n4）预言机\n区块链与链外方交互通常需要预言机，已在以太坊等区块链上得到良好实现和应用。没有预言机，区块链上的智能合约将完全局限于链上数据。但与区块链相比，BRC-100协议具有非常特殊的特性。它不仅具有与区块链相同的计算能力，还依赖于链外索引器来完成计算。同时，链外索引器能够直接与其他区块链或元协议通信，但区块链做不到这一点，这意味着索引器可以通过足够的证明数据验证任何链上或链外数据，以满足BRC-100协议的预言机要求。例如：验证BTC或BRC-20资产的转移，验证以太坊某个区块上的ETH价格等。换句话说，在BRC-100协议中，预言机有一个新范式：证明和验证，用户提交证明数据，索引器作为预言机验证器来验证用户提交的链外证明数据，无需独立的预言机服务。\n在BRC-100协议中，索引器可以验证证明数据，以确保状态的一致性和正确性，证明可以是转账证明、Merkle树证明、零知识证明、价格证明等，可用于桥接资产、空投、比特币第二层、借贷中的清算等场景。\n除了以上的已经实现的功能外，还有其他新功能正在开发中。从上面几个更新可以看出铭文本身距离在大饼链上实现amm，借贷等常见功能并不远了，也许在将来并不需要跨链到二层就可以在原链上实现defi功能。三. 思考与结论\n1、BRC100是一个协议，上面的BRC100代币是龙头币种，属于meme性质，跟ordi一个性质。作为brc20创始人domo看中的协议，相信不会差。"

            "full_text": "首先要澄清一个概念BRC100是一个协议的名称，正如BRC20一样，上面可以部署任意名称的铭文，BRC100协议的龙头叫做BRC100；\n数量：2100万，已经属于全流通；\n购买地址：https://t.co/fF69gdyxkF\nBRC-100基于序数理论，提出了一种模块化的协议和应用方法：继承和嵌套。这为BRC-100协议和应用的扩展提供了理论基础。它本质上描述了一个具有计算能力和状态的代币，这种代币的行为是BRC-20协议的扩展。BRC-100基于两种模型：UTXO模型和状态机模型，这极大地扩展了比特币的计算能力。代币操作符合UTXO模型，而计算符合状态机模型。BRC-100还引入了新的操作：burn2/burn3和mint2/mint3，使得代币可以在UTXO模型和状态机模型之间安全转换。用简单一点的话来理解就是：BRC100协议属于BRC20协议的升级版，涵盖更多的功能\n本节重点讲解一下BRC100协议与BRC20协议的不一样之处。BRC20协议发的铭文具备token与NFT二相性，BRC20发币的时候只有一个mint动作，任何人都可以mint，直到完全mint完后就成全流通状态，可以实现转账功能。BRC20实现了一种全新的资产发行方式，但是也仅仅只是发行了资产，资产全流通后除了可以转账外并没有其他功能。缺乏像以太坊那样的智能合约功能可能会给一些项目带来困恼，不能实现代币回购、销毁、锁定等等功能。BRC100正是为了解决这些问题而诞生，虽然不足以媲美以太坊的智能合约，但是也发展了除了转账外的许多功能。下面是BRC100协议已经实现了的升级的部分\nBRC-100协议提供了三种铸币操作符：mint、mint2和mint3，用于在不同场景中铸造代币。在部署应用程序时，需要设置公众可铸造的代币数量。剩余的代币将使用操作符：\"mint\"来铸造。\nmint：公共铸币，任何人都可以向用户铸造代币，但通过\"mint\"操作符铸造的代币总量不能超过应用程序的最大设置。铸造后，代币的流通供应量将增加。\nmint2：白名单铸币，应用程序记录可以铸币的用户或应用程序数量，任何人都可以根据应用程序规则向用户或应用程序铸造mint2代币。铸造mint2后，代币的流通供应量也将增加。\nmint3：状态铸币，mint3在其他应用程序中铸造用户或应用程序的余额，任何人都可以根据应用程序规则向用户或应用程序铸造mint3代币。铸造mint3后，代币的流通供应量不会增加。\n2）burn\n销毁是BRC-100协议新引入的操作。用户可以刻录销毁操作的铭文，然后将铭文转移给应用程序的部署者，这与转账操作的语义相似。然后，被刻录的代币将被销毁或转移到应用程序的余额中。与铸造操作的定义类似，有三种销毁操作符：burn、burn2和burn3，分别对应于mint、mint2和mint3。所有应用程序/代币都支持这三种销毁操作符，无需额外配置。\nburn：公共销毁，任何人都可以使用操作符销毁代币。代币成功销毁后，流通供应量将减少，且销毁的代币不能再次铸造。\nburn2：白名单销毁，根据应用程序预设规则，向应用程序销毁burn2代币后，用户的余额将减少，应用程序的状态也将相应更新，流通供应量将减少。在实践中，例如在AMM DEX中移除流动性的逻辑可以通过burn2实现。\nburn3：状态销毁，burn3将减少用户的代币余额，并增加\"to\"应用程序的余额。在实践中，它可以与mint3一起使用，以完成AMM DEX中的代币交换、添加流动性等逻辑。\n3）交易税和通货紧缩\nBRC-100协议引入了一种新的代币交易机制：交易税和通货紧缩。应用程序可以设定交易税比例、税收接收者和交易黑洞百分比。这些设置仅在基于AMM的去中心化交易所中交易时生效。普通的转账、铸造和销毁操作不会触发交易税和通货紧缩。\n4）预言机\n区块链与链外方交互通常需要预言机，已在以太坊等区块链上得到良好实现和应用。没有预言机，区块链上的智能合约将完全局限于链上数据。但与区块链相比，BRC-100协议具有非常特殊的特性。它不仅具有与区块链相同的计算能力，还依赖于链外索引器来完成计算。同时，链外索引器能够直接与其他区块链或元协议通信，但区块链做不到这一点，这意味着索引器可以通过足够的证明数据验证任何链上或链外数据，以满足BRC-100协议的预言机要求。例如：验证BTC或BRC-20资产的转移，验证以太坊某个区块上的ETH价格等。换句话说，在BRC-100协议中，预言机有一个新范式：证明和验证，用户提交证明数据，索引器作为预言机验证器来验证用户提交的链外证明数据，无需独立的预言机服务。\n在BRC-100协议中，索引器可以验证证明数据，以确保状态的一致性和正确性，证明可以是转账证明、Merkle树证明、零知识证明、价格证明等，可用于桥接资产、空投、比特币第二层、借贷中的清算等场景。\n除了以上的已经实现的功能外，还有其他新功能正在开发中。从上面几个更新可以看出铭文本身距离在大饼链上实现amm，借贷等常见功能并不远了，也许在将来并不需要跨链到二层就可以在原链上实现defi功能。三. 思考与结论\n1、BRC100是一个协议，上面的BRC100代币是龙头币种，属于meme性质，跟ordi一个性质。作为brc20创始人domo看中的协议，相信不会差。"

            "full_text": "Vitalik的新文章看似重申了以太坊的Cypherpunk精神（去中心化、抗审查、可审计、工具组件、开放合作），其实是其对当下生态过于金融化（Degen）的隐忧和不满。\n\n如何脱离纯Degen困境呢 ? @VitalikButerin  提出了积极发展的五大方向，我简单附加一些个人点评：\n\n1） Rollups are starting to actually exist.\n\n点评：过去一年，layer2赛道呈现一片市场竞和繁荣的景象，layer2 War正在激烈开打，对以太坊而言，Rollups链越多，引流+赋能也会越多。但以太坊layer2正在被各类RaaS方案+DA方案以及模块化的VM方案等逐渐抢占市场，layer2市场正逃离以太坊的正统性精神掌控。\n\n于以太坊而言，这确实不是Vitalik想看到的，但于Crypto行业而言，layer2的市场终局不可避免的会走向亲以太坊和离以太坊两大派系。最终，哪些layer2能跑出来，不会受限于政治正统性的束缚，而要看能不能推动Mass Adoption的发生。\n\n2） Following a temporary lull after the regulatory crackdowns on Tornado Cash, second-generation privacy solutions such as Railway and Nocturne are seeing the (moon) light.\n\n点评：Privacy Centric 隐私交易是一个听上去很有必要但落地很慢的赛道。因为DEX环境下的公开透明、MEV空间以及交易意图等暴露问题，大部分做市商以及个人Trader高玩倾向于把重心放在CEX。\n\n未来DEX能不能和CEX持平，全靠Privacy infra的建设。第一代隐私交易解决方案，Tornado通过合约层拆分资金混淆资产的方式被大量用于非法洗钱，遭到监管频繁制裁；第二代隐私交易方案，都是通过中间隐私层，无论是Nocturne的Teller和handler还是Railway的Relayer都承接了隐私交易的From地址角色，用户的真实交易意图通过中间层会得到隐藏。\n\n具体实现技术，通常有ZK-Snarks、AA账户抽象的Paymaster、以及MPC可信环境下的多签管理等。用户只需要把资产Wrap成隐私资产，之后向中间层发起交易意图，中间层Pool就会代为完成一系列的DeFi交互。这个中间层沉淀的资产越多，用户量越大，隐私效果越好，关键可以有合规解决方案并行存在，更容易成为未来主流。（找机会详细分析）\n\n3） Account abstraction is starting to take off.\n\n点评：市场已经对账户抽象Account Abstraction脱敏了，因为它太基础了，只有到了应用层爆发阶段，账户抽象的价值才能显现。应该说，账户抽象像补丁一样，让以太坊有了不被Solana等高性能公链抽走流动性的底气。\n\n况且眼下，账户抽象赛道已经很繁荣了，只不过大多方案偏向于底层Infra构建，尚未得到市场验证，大家感觉起来无关痛痒。但我认为，以太坊layer2能不能真正迸发高频应用且成为增量用户的入口，账户抽象是个必选题。玩layer2，一定不要忘记选一些账户抽象底层的应用。\n\n4） Light clients, forgotten for a long time, are starting to actually exist.\n\n点评：轻客户端在以太坊转POS之后更为重要了，因为它可以延展以太坊Validators的验证能力，让以太坊的共识延伸到其他链。比如：如果做一套三方DA方案，可以用Restaking模式，让以太坊的一部分validators参与进侧链共识的维护工作中，相比纯第三方validators构建的共识会更有说服力；又比如；做一套去中心化Sequencer方案，也可以用Restaking，让以太坊的Validators参与到侧链Sequencer的梯队当中。\n\n这一切设想的前提都要基于轻客户端方案，大家熟悉的Eigenlayer就是基于轻客户端实现了以太坊Validators能力的扩展。从战略高度看，这套方案是以太坊对抗第三方DA入侵维护自己以太坊正统地位的有力武器。\n\n5） Zero knowledge proofs, a technology which we thought was decades away, are now here, are increasingly developer-friendly, and are on the cusp of being usable for consumer applications.\n\n点评：零知识证明曾经有多被热捧和期许，现今就有多唏嘘和失望。因为，零知识证明在隐私和扩展问题上解决问题并不能立竿见影看到效果。比如OP-Rollup和ZK-Rollup争到最后，都知道ZK更牛逼，但掩盖不了OP却比ZK更流行的事实。\n\n在我看来，ZK技术更适用于未来，也超脱于纯金融叙事之外，眼下大家对ZK唏嘘的emotion可以理解，但到了真正的应用时代，ZK会成为区块链一样的必要存在。（这话貌似Vitalik也说过）。"

            "full_text": "Casey雄文回应意识形态上的比特币最大主义者 ：（机器翻译，原文在转发的Blog里）\n\n如果你问我的观点，由于缺乏更好的术语，它们与意识形态比特币最大主义者的观点几乎无法区分。我厌恶国家，不特别尊重权威，并认为比特币是摆脱法定货币造成的我们生活和文明的放荡堕落的道路。\n\n然而，我不认为自己是一个意识形态的比特币最大主义者，主要原因是意识形态往往无法在与现实的接触中生存。\n\n这是意识形态比特币极大主义和随之而来的平淡文化目前所处的不可羡慕的立场：与它不相应的现实进行不舒服的接触。\n\n意识形态的比特币极大主义有很多好处。正是因为这些事情，这篇博客文章才被写出来。这篇文章包含对意识形态比特币最大主义者的建议，这些建议有望帮助他们停止进球和犯非强迫性错误。换句话说，他们如何停止成为失败者。\n\n首先，让我说，这个帖子不是为了捍卫序数和铭文而写的。他们不需要防守。猫从袋子里出来了，没有人能把它放回去。\n\n现在，寻求建议。\n\n我的第一个建议是，抱怨铭文会让你和比特币看起来很弱。同时认为比特币是不可阻挡的互联网资金，并认为一群在链上发布JPEG的弱智是任何类型的问题，这是一个矛盾。我们都知道真相，即推一推，前者是真的，后者是假的。比特币是不可阻挡的互联网货币，JPEG不是问题。但是，通过拥护这两种信念，你削弱了任何关于比特币可以抵制国家的论点。\n\n尽管在推特上发牢骚，但没有人能在序数和铭文上做出如此多的印痕。因此，鉴于此，鉴于我们在摧毁法定货币方面还有重要工作要做，也许你应该停止抱怨一些你无法改变的事情，并适应NFT已经来到比特币的新的、可能令人不舒服的现实？毫无疑问，这不会是人们最后一次开始在比特币上做不愉快的事情，所以现在开始接受它将是一个很好的练习。然后，您可以将精力重新集中在更重要的事情上，例如传播Satoshi的好话，并帮助尽可能多的人学习如何使用比特币。\n\n此外，从战略上讲，所有媒体都是好的媒体，抱怨铭文只会让更多的人了解它们，并使铭文人员特别热衷于将nakadashi JPEGs放入区块链，只是为了让你看起来像个白痴。如果正常人喜欢做某事，那么你不会通过责骂他们这样做来交任何朋友，或在任何事情上取得任何进展。\n\n如果你仍然坚持抱怨铭文，至少花点时间了解它们，这样你就可以抛弃你最糟糕和最不令人信服的论点。这些包括：\n\n任何人都可以右键单击保存JPEG。 从字面上看，每个堕落的购买铭文都知道这一点。 从字面上看，每一个。 没有人根据他们购买访问权限的错觉而购买铭文。 接受这一点并更新你的世界观将使其更接近现实，并且不太可能被它摧毁。\n\n铭文不是真的，它们只是一种集体幻觉。 从第一天起，我基本上就是这么说的，序数和铭文是查看比特币的选择镜头。 表现得好像这是某种该死的启示，让你看起来像个白痴。 此外，它表明你误解了关于人类、文明和文化的最基本的东西之一：所有重要的只是社会习俗。 事实上，比特币只是一个社会习俗。 或者，换句话说，重要的不是软件或数据，而是围绕它的社会习俗。 铭文也不例外。\n\n您只需将数据链外存储即可。人们重视链上数据。它使铭文稀缺，并极大地提高了可靠性和用户安全性。所有其他NFT生态系统都使用链外数据，不知情的用户将信任委托给碰巧将文件固定在IPFS上的人，他们可能会随时停止。链上数据是不信任的巨大改进，据我所知，这受到意识形态的高度重视。\n\n铭文是非法的。非法的事情，如国家暴力，和你认为愚蠢的事情之间有明显的区别。认为某事是非法的，因为你不喜欢它或看不到它的目的，这会让你看起来像个弱智。\n\n铭文是一种国家攻击。不知何故，你在其他链上看到NFT和shitcoins，明白它们的存在是因为热情、需求、欺骗和退化，不认为这些东西是对以太坊的国家攻击，并以某种方式转过身来，认为它们是对比特币的国家攻击？\n\n试图审查铭文与试图审查其他类型的交易完全相同。您建造的任何机器或您召集的公共支持都将立即支持对比特币的总体审查。幸运的是，处理某人认为非法的交易正是比特币的建立，所以你最终会失败，但如果你不试图说服人们审查比特币交易是他们应该费心去尝试的事情，我们都会更好。你已经设法混淆了海洋采矿，认为这是可能的，是个好主意，尽管他们最终会比现在更进一步地弯曲膝盖，但如果我们再买一个采矿池，而不是不必要地把它挖出大门，那就太好了。\n\n那么，你应该如何处理铭文呢？\n\n忽略它们。更有价值的用例将为大多数铭文定价。总会有一些高价值的铭文，但它们不会与硬钱和不可审查的交易进行认真竞争。比特币的命运是高额费用。拥抱它。\n\n我们有更大的鱼要炸，如果你有兴趣做的不仅仅是珍珠抓捕和订婚养殖，我们都可以炸它们。"

            "full_text": "#BTC #ETH #Binance #OKX  #Huobi \n这几天由于国内的一则新闻，大家又都在聊如何安全出金的事情，我从21年入币圈以来，三大所的出金我都有用过，出入金次数有超过50次，最终冻过三次卡，最近一年出入金10余次还没冻过；\n\n所以自己也是踩过很多坑的，而且自认为现在的出金方式是比较稳定的，所以分享一下自己的出入金坎坷历程，纯粹个人经验，不做深度分析；\n\n因为入金几乎都不会有问题，主要就是出金的问题，所以我下面也就只讨论出金方面的经验；\n\n首先是火币：我21年初进入币圈时用的是火币，当时自然而然的选择在火币进行出入金，那时候还不太了解出入金存在的风险，卖币就是直接选择价格最高的U商交易，不看任何信息，在火币最终出金有七、八次，被冻卡一次【光大银行】，当时冻完后三天之后就自动解冻了，但过一段时间又被冻了，现在那张卡已经可以正常使用，但我已经不再用了；\n\n其次是OKX：在519事件后，火币在21年年底宣布清退中国用户，我转战到了OKX进行交易，所以我后续的出金也都是在OKX完成，几乎22年的一整年我都是在OKX上交易、出入金的；\n\n其中出金次数大概有小20次，此时的我在出金时已具备风险意识了，所以我在OKX上每次出金时并不是直接选择价格最高的U商，而是会点进去看一下这个U商的交易时长和交易次数，我会选择【交易时长在一年以上】、【交易次数至少过千】的商家，很长一段时间没有再冻过卡，但在22年的下半年，我连续被冻了两张卡，一张是南京银行、一张是招商银行，其中招商银行还是我的工资卡，南京银行也是3天左右自动解冻；招商银行的解冻比较麻烦，需要我本人去派出所签署一份协议，承诺没有参与洗钱交易，因为这是我的工资卡，所以最终我是去派出所签署协议后，才解冻的；\n\n最后是币安：在OKX上出金连续被冻两张卡后，我开始有点怕了，毕竟已经被冻了三张卡了，再冻下去，都没有干净的卡了......\n\n所以就开始去币安上出金，但大量的交易还是在OKX上，为何我还在OKX交易呢，其实在火币清退后，我是同时注册了OKX和币安的，但因为币安的交易操作界面不符合我的审美，我更喜欢OKX的UI风格，所以当时我就还是把OKX当做主要交易账户；\n\nOKX的下单体验其实是非常差的，经常性的卡顿，到现在这种情况都没有改善，我曾经一度以为是我的手机问题，但后来我换了手机后依然是经常性的卡顿，与之相比币安下单真的是非常的丝滑，除瀑布行情交易所集体拔网线外，我还没有感受过卡顿；\n\n因为OKX的下单卡顿问题一直存在，虽然我很喜欢OK的UI风格，但币安的下单体验确实太丝滑了，所以最近一年我的主要交易账户都是在币安，出金也就都是在币安；\n\n我在币安上出金经历了两个阶段：\n\n第一阶段：和在OKX上出金一样，我会筛选【交易时长超过一年】、【交易次数破千】的U价较高的商家，这样出了大概有5-6次后，虽然没有冻过卡，但是心理总有那个被冻卡的阴影在.......\n\n第二阶段：也就是我目前的出金方式，因为现在很担心自己再有卡被冻，所以我就在U价和安全两者之间做了取舍，选择用币安神盾来出金；\n\n币安神盾一般会有0.5个点左右的价差，这也是我一开始没有用币安神盾出金的原因，每次出金几万，0.5个点就是好几百，确实有点心疼；\n\n总结：\n目前大家出金的交易所一般都是OKX或者币安，我的经验如下：\n\nOKX：OKX上脏钱很多，冻卡的几率非常大，我被冻过两次；\n\n币安：币安普通U商的安全性相对还是比较高的，我通过普通U商出的没有被冻过；币安神盾我认为是最安全的出金方式，我自己通过币安神盾出金有10余次，至今还没有被冻过；\n\n所以出金我的建议是尽量不用OKX，选择币安出金，如果追求更安全的方式则直接用币安神盾；"

            "full_text": "2023.12.3\n记录\n\n接上文，计划在小图片涨了一轮之后全部卖出，但是在这期间有些变化，我卖掉了MNCHRMS买了Ordirocks，在这里感谢byd @0xBeyondLee 按头，30u（算上gas大概在0.0007-9左右）的时候扫了一些，0.00999的价格全部卖了，挂单的时候我觉得我大概率卖飞，写记录的时候ordirocks已经去零了，一般第一次去零会持续上涨一段时间，在它短期可能去零和可能不去零之间我选择了他不去零的挂单方式，不过有赚就行，没有必要赚到最后一个钢镚\n\n现在的持仓就是900个USDT，除了NeoYauto这个图片卖不出去，其他的小图片都清仓了，然后被朋友按头打了mice，前前后后打了五十张，总共算下来差不多是1500U，按照上一篇记录的计划，多出来的部分已经出金。\n这大概率是我25年之前最后一次出金，如果接下来如果我运气好还有得赚，需要不断适应和学习不同本金的心态和操作，在牛市之前把心态和能力打磨好，不至于到时候不知所措。\n本来是拿了sol空单的，但是和一些朋友聊了聊还是先平仓了。\n\n这一个月大概率不会有很多操作，因为又要期末考试了（烦），还有就是赚了钱之后很容易有错误操作，所以在这段时间里我会降低操作频率，可能会偶尔试一下小杠杆小仓位做空，学学怎么做合约\n所以有时候为了尽量避免犯错，我会在持有现在这个币或者铭文的时候就想好下一步或者下下一步该怎么做，起码在开始执行下一步操作的这段时间里有时间去好好想该不该这样做，如果不对就修正。虽然有时候计划赶不上变化，但是我感觉大方向不变应该就还算ok\n\n记录一下我拿Ordirocks期间观察到的一些情况\n\n项目背后有没有大资本我不知道，不过这个项目出现的时机是挺好的，大饼新高，ordi新高，诅咒铭文马上绝版，又赶上了BTC生态的牛市，还有一大堆博主给它站台\n每一次要拉盘的前兆很明显，比如说有段时间价格0.0033，拉盘前会有人先把0.0035的单子扫掉一部分。跌也很难跌下去，尤其是整数附近，有人挂低价单子很快就被扫掉了，如果没被扫我感觉大概率是做市商挂的\n它涨这么快我理解的是生态火热的时间就这么几天，新项目得趁热打铁，不太可能慢慢拉盘，我观察到洗盘方式就是会有人专门挂很低价的单子诈出不坚定的筹码然后吃掉，或者是BTC链有时候出块很慢，做市商会等gas低一些，或者刚出块不久开始扫单，在这期间也会洗出一些心急的筹码\n\n然后记一下我持仓的操作和心态\n\n30U之后涨上去了我没有加仓，我的主要操作就是随缘收，一是因为没什么钱加了，二是只要离开我的心理价位我就不会再买了。这里面有执行力的一些原因，在15-30U这个价格区间只有48小时不到的时间，可能听起来时间很长，但是如果没去看或者研究，很快就会错过这个区间了\n说是研究其实也没研究很仔细吧，主要是因为它是阴阳铭文，BTC生态最近行情也很好，又是大佬按着头叫上车的，运气好就买到了，这轮也是行情赏饭吃\n\n持仓心态大概就是涨得越高我越慌张，虽然成本够低，可能我还没有习惯这种涨得很快的感觉吧，得慢慢习惯才行。想了想可能是因为我对它没有估值，卖点我是靠感觉来的，主要是我不太清楚该怎么给它估值，无论是对标大鹅还是什么，btc上现在还活着的NFT洗盘的时间比它久很多，换手率，持仓人数什么的也不一样，所以直接对标总觉得不太准确哈哈哈\n\n对于mice我也稍微看了看，还挺有意思的，一些Alpha小群里面也提到它了，没mint完但是交易量奇高，头一次见，所以买了一些玩一玩当做冲土狗了（非交易建议）\n\n接下来所有的操作都会附图片在记录里面，不是为了炫耀什么，主要是方便我后续求职之类的，因为我的推文主要是记录贴，可以留个证明"

            "full_text": "市场出现了“并行EVM”的新叙事，于layer2就非常有意思了，可实现一种“精细化”Rollup新范式，夸张点可达成Solana成为以太坊新layer2的魔改效果。\n\n在我看来，并行EVM只是Rollup高度“模块化”的显学，是DA被第三方侵袭之后，VM执行层的再度沦陷，未来layer2会被重新定义。Why？接下来，以科普视角分析下：\n\n理解这个话题，得先厘清“EVM”的单线程执行模型。\n\n该模型规定了交易必须按顺序一个接一个地被处理和确认，这直接影响了交易处理速度、出块时间、以及交易吞吐量等，是以太坊主网Gas高且拥堵的主要原因。而且，之所以设计成单线程，有一定历史局限性存在。\n\n由于以太坊上的交易由分布的独立节点验证和执行完成，且要保证所有地址的数据，比如余额、智能合约代码等保持不同节点间的状态一致，与此同时还得保证不会有同一资产双重支付的可能性出现。\n\n这就使得交易得按顺序排队处理。如果出现并行交易，就可能导致节点之间的数据同步出错，关键是还会出现严重的双花交易。\n\n通俗解释：银行只有一个服务窗口，客户取款要按顺序排队，无论是存款取款以及贷款等业务，一个客户完成业务后才能开始下一个，优点是，银行的账户系统的每项操作都会精准记录，但客户排队时间会比较长；\n\n若银行开放多个服务窗口，客户可选择窗口办理不同业务，就会出现有两个窗口同时尝试从一个账户中扣款，若窗口间账户系统对账不及时 就会导致双花，显然这样做明显提升了效率，但复杂的记账逻辑会对账务系统带来压力。\n\n在layer1独立链场景下，如果链底层支持并行处理问题就迎刃而解了，Solana由于计算和存储状态分离，因此其VM在收到用户的多笔交易后，节点会对这些交易进行排序，然后调用独立的存储系统状态数据检测这些交易是否存在状态冲突，若无冲突就将交易打包到一个区块中，若冲突则将冲突的交易排除到本次区块外。\n\n相较之下，以太坊的存储状态是实时计算出来的，每个交易必须等待前一笔交易完成才能更新状态，故而就无法做到在等待打包前的交易筛选工作，限制了其并行处理的可能性。\n\n在layer2 Rollup链场景下，要实现并行处理，远离也类似。你可以把Solana在等待POH时间戳的交易计算和存储状态检测视为Rollup链在Sequener处理交易然后向主网Batch的过程。\n\n现在layer2在Batch交易前Sequener会先按时间顺序给交易排nonce，然后按顺序Batch到主网，如何才能做到多线程呢？\n\n1）可基于AA账户抽象模型，从账户状态上实现了可以同时发起多笔交易，比如，若同时执行两笔Transfer，AA智能合约会赋予其nonce，需要按顺序执行，若一笔是Transfer，一笔是Approve则就可以不受nonce限制更灵活的并行处理。在AA账户模型中，每个账户可以自定义交易处理逻辑，进而配合nonce实现高并发。\n\n2）可对Sequencer中的交易进行“精细化”的加工处理，比如当layer2的交易被提交到Sequencer中，Sequencer可以快速的检测这些交易逻辑，并进行精细化排序和筛查工作，比如若同一账户发起了两笔Transfer，就要把后一笔排除在外，等待下一次Batch，若同一账户发起两笔性质不同的操作，就可以同时Batch到一个区块中。\n\n听上去很简单？但事实情况绝非如此，仅以DeFi场景为例，Sequencer要实现交易的精细化管理，存在两大挑战：\n\n1）要实时解析交易数据，了解传入数据的智能合约调用方法及参数，以DeFi常见的Staking为例，一次Staking操作，涉及代币转移、状态更新、质押期限、以及潜在奖励计算等。若同时有大量用户传入一些质押交易，若其中还参杂质押后再Transfer的交易，再加上复杂的Oralce价格因素等等，若Sequener无法解析处理到位，一步出现错误都可能导致严重事故。\n\n2）Sequencer得确保去中心化，当前layer2 Sequener只是Batch交易的前提下，权利都已经过大了，若Sequencer去中心化问题解决不了，再来做“精细化”Rollup，等于又赋予Sequencer更多的权限。若Sequencer在中作恶塞假交易，明目张胆搞MEV夹子，甚至恶意操控Oracle清算等等都会滋生。\n\n最近，Metis受追捧，表面上看只是Sequencer实现了去中心化，深层次看则是为未来Sequencer做精细化Rollup构建了基本的共识前提。\n\n当然，靠Sequencer做到高度精细化的Rollup交易汇聚和处理，目前还只是一种设想，好在，AA账户抽象，区块链整体的模块化组合开放思想给这一设想落到实处提供了先决条件。\n\n以上。\n\n况且正如前文所言，现在layer2整体日趋模块化，在OP Stack的框架上嵌入ZK技术来实现隐私扩展；把原先的以太坊DA转化成Celestia这类第三方DA来降低成本；逐渐把ETH作为Gas费的传统也变革掉了，给予layer2代币更大的实用性赋能；甚至，layer2完全也可以Batch好交易后提交给不同的VM执行环境，交易分到Solana和以太坊上处理等等。\n\n到时候，一个全新的的范式出现了，现在的layer2不再单单是以太坊的layer2，Solana也可以做以太坊的layer2，甚至layer2的定义也会被魔改。\n\n大胆设想，现在layer2变成了一个集成高并发交易处理能力的入口级“layer1”，而以太坊、Solana这些曾经的layer1变成一个做资产结算和安全性保障的新“layer2”。\n\nlayer2从来都不是一个死板的概念，layer2平台们要解决交易大规模并发处理，吸引增量用户市场群体的使命一直存在。\n\n若使命达成，在模块化思想下，不仅以太坊layer1的正统性会被打破，整个全链的DA数据可用性、VM执行层甚至interoperability通信交互都会成为layer2们实现Mass Adoption的infra。\n\n届时，layer2不再只是layer1的补充，而成为一个功能强大的综合型交易汇聚和分发处理平台，试问，谁才是谁的layer2？"

            "full_text": "最近，layer2总算打破沉寂扬眉吐气了一把，$OP、$ARB、$METIS等代币大放异彩，像极了坎昆升级前夜的Show Time时刻。\n\n为啥坎昆升级后的layer2“竞争内卷”才真正拉开帷幕，坎昆升级后layer2的市场格局会如何演变？接下来，说说我的看法：\n\n1）以太坊坎昆升级EIP4844 Proto-Danksharding提案落地，会给layer2 Rollup项目带来“质”的提振。\n\n通过引入Blob空间新数据结构，迭代了过去依赖calldata存放数据的受限性，同时提升了以太坊主网的Data availability能力。\n\n相比calldata的全节点存储结构，Blob被设计为部分节点临时存储，这样可以大幅提升layer2单次向主网提交的数据上限，可以扩大其TPS，同时由于只是临时存储，数据存储效率会提升，数据存储成本也直线下滑。而DA能力的提升是因为1个月的临时存储，来应对OP-Rollup 7天的欺诈证明时间窗口也绰绰有余。\n\n结果是，layer2单次向主网提交的交易量会大幅提升，均摊给单个用户的费用也会明显下降。坎昆升级前layer2吹嘘自身TPS有多大，但大多是测试环境，反倒用户直观感受到的Gas费磨损糟糕体验，会让大家觉得layer2名不副其实。\n\n坎昆升级后，layer2选手们没了主网的性能瓶颈，再也不能以主网受限为借口，TPS、Gas这些硬指标会直接成为考验，也是layer2重塑竞争格局的一个关键。\n\n这正是为何我一再强调，坎昆升级后，layer2的竞争局面才真正拉开序幕；\n\n2）坎昆升级后，layer2市场内卷大战加剧，新秀频出挑战OP+ZK既有格局。\n\n针对Sequencer的去中心化问题，一直是市场关注焦点，结果大家发现在layer2赛道强势的OP-Rollup，去中心化Sequencer变成了Stack联盟性质的社会共识“软去中心化”。\n\nWhatsoever，大家尽管批判Optimism在去中心化不作为问题，Optimism凭借OP-Stack实际带来的市场成功似乎也可以扭转局面。但，你能说，OP-Rollup就是Rollup的全部了吗？显然不能，更合理的市场演变趋势是，OP-Stack的成功之处会进一步放大，OP-Stack的空白之处，也自然会有其他接力者。\n\n这两天，layer2去中心化Sequencer方案提供方 @MetisDAO   二级市场表现非凡，7D 超100%涨幅很是夺目，其TVL锁仓数据也一举飞升至5.4亿美元，已经逼近zkSync，Why？\n\n核心商业逻辑很简单，既然OP-Rollup在sequencer去中心化问题上止步不前，作为接力者，提出一套合理的去中心化Sequencer方案就是它的市场空间。\n\n因为，Sequencer去中心化问题，事关layer2提交交易的可信度问题，也事关layer2交易的主网交互安全性问题，如果撇开“根基”这个问题不谈，坎昆升级后的TPS和Gas费率似乎都成了“空中楼阁”，我不否认Optimism在Stack战略上的成功，但Sequencer的去中心化问题总会有其他破局者解决。\n\nMetis以POS质押的方式，运行多个Sequencer候补节点，节点之间通过竞选机制来竞争出块奖励，同时作恶也会被Slash惩罚。这种POS共识把每个Sequencer作为利益关联方捆绑成一个利益共同体，Metis基金会则利用Token的激励，斥资460万枚$METIS代币来激励Sequencer挖矿、新项目部署等等后续生态。\n\n和Optimism相比，Metis市值还偏低，不和OP正面拼刺刀，仅去中心化Sequencer一项也能打开一片广阔市场。\n\nMetis只是近期抢眼典型范例，在我看来坎昆升级后，layer2的市场规模还会进一步扩大，新锐的layer2供应方，要从OP和ZK两大巨鳄嘴里抢肉吃，还会奇招尽出，把layer2赛道卷出新天际，当然更多的机会也会在新锐layer2上。\n\n3）layer2逐渐模块化演变，正统性会被冲破，侠义的layer2会被广义的layer2所取代。\n\n我之前在多篇文章中提到，layer2的核心是以太坊的DA能力，如果主网的全节点不参与layer2数据安全性的验证，主网其实就成了一个“公告板”，layer2就无法继承主网的安全性。因此依赖以太坊DA的就是侠义layer2，而逃脱以太坊DA范畴的都是广义layer2。（激进点也可以不认可其为layer2）\n\n但当layer2市场大到一定规模，纯侠义的以太坊layer2正统性可能会被打破边界。道理和OP-Rollup的Fraud proof欺诈证明没有实际的battle-tested挑战产生也能被市场选择性忽略一样。技术只是商业逻辑的一环，市场和生态才说了算，好比Optimism总能以乐观之名出奇迹。\n\n这意味着，坎昆升级后第三方DA解决方案会入侵layer2，包括 @CelestiaOrg 的 第三方DA方案, @EspressoSys 的共享Sequencer方案等。尽管大家都不情不愿，但模块化演变的商业逻辑会逐渐打破以太坊主网能守住的防线。\n\nOP-Stack堆栈推行的重点是实现共享Sequencer，未来OP战略同盟越多，其通过Sequencer能抓住的利益就会越大，相反其受到的多方利益牵扯也会变大，这种社会共识会成为技术之外的新掣肘，把Optimism稳固在一个老大哥的位置；\n\nZK-Stack堆栈的重点则是实现共享Prover系统，其自身的DA能力以及Celestia这类第三方DA能力，当然主网的有限DA能力，都会属于ZK的战略圈地范围，其发展重点是layer3 Hyperchains的新多链ZK版图界面，DA由谁提供并不是关键。\n\n他们的利益导向决定了，其实都可以不在乎DA在哪，在乎DA的只有以太坊本尊。所以面对Celestia的持续抢夺DA市场，Vitalik才为Plasma+ZK摇旗呐喊，但忙于战略扩张的OP+ZK并不care这些，他们只关心，他们的Stack战略覆盖的layer2阵营会有多大，毕竟RaaS才是layer2的商业终局。\n\n总而言之，坎昆升级后的layer2赛道会异常精彩，无论是新锐的频频亮剑，还是layer2战略边界的扩张，都会激发layer2市场走向“多样化”繁荣。\n\nlayer2赛道最终会成为一个整合ZK技术+OP框架+各类DA方案+各类Sequencer服务+各类Gas费模型等共同构成的高度模块化的市场。"

            "full_text": "最近，Solana带领Avalanche、NEAR等layer1公链大杀四方，市场又传出杀死以太坊的声音。 确实，ETH Killer是上一轮牛市大部分公链手握的王牌叙事。\n\n不过，在EVM一统江湖，layer2尚未爆发的当下，单靠MEME、DePin等叙事不足以撼动ETH的市场地位。这只是坎昆升级前，Alt-Layer1的短暂狂欢，Why？\n\n1）各大公链争相杀死以太坊的叙事，已然被一轮牛熊周期充分验证“失败了”。表面上看这源于以太坊强大的市场共识，和开发者群体创新力量，以及DeFi、NFT金融应用无限组合的魔力。\n\n实际上因为，Crypto市场还受限于技术、市场、合规等因素并未实现Mass Adoption大规模普及，这些新公链带来的技术“跃迁”并没有成为激发新叙事，扩大新市场增量的抓手，还仅仅在吃以太坊的溢出红利。\n\nSolana、Avalanche、Aptos等公链想从开发语言、代码复杂度、运行机制等底层框架彻底提升技术水平，为应用市场提供更好的infra。比如，Solana的高并发处理性能和用户体验UX优势，单论技术确实更适用于未来增量Crypto市场。\n\n只不过，眼下市场基本运作逻辑还没真正蜕变。\n\n偏好风险的游资，渴求财富密码的市场受众，不断刷新的多样玩法，始终存在的信息差，偶尔溢出圈的暴富故事等等，这些完美构成了周期性的牛市基本要素。\n\n这让技术“先天局限”的以太坊，愣是靠各类EIP、ERC标准协议等缝缝补补，也足以衍生出一个庞大的应用市场，还能让其他竞品公链仅靠溢出效应就能频频冒头。\n\n但大家都在吃以太坊DeFi市场红利，还没到Alt-layer1 可以轻松取代并超越以太坊的时候。\n\n2）以太坊“先天缺陷”已经探索出了一整套成熟解决方案，比如：扩容问题，演变出了Rollup、Plasma、Validium等各类方案；又比如：EOA地址局限，靠ERC4337 Account Abstraction也得到了升级，甚至演变出了一个账户抽象赛道；\n\n此外，layer2也同样成了一个叙事赛道，OP-Rollup和ZK-Rollup展开持续拉锯战等；后续还有坎昆升级后的Blob空间以及更遥远的Sharding分片、底层SNARK化等来提供后续发展支撑；\n\n即便是区块容量上限潜在的DA能力局限问题，也延伸出了Eigenlayer等基于Restaking方案来优化DA，再通过模块化组合Celestia这类三方DA方案，以及对VM执行层的可选替代方案等等。\n\n整个以太坊的开发、扩容、外延环境已经足够成熟和繁荣。它背后的开发者力量才是大以太屹立不倒的基石。\n\n虽然以太坊过去几年，持续叠乐高构建生态的落地结果确实不及预期，但能在频发的黑客攻击下，完成POW到POS的关键升级，又能把开发者资源聚拢在以以太坊EVM为中心的主线上，且能演变出一个更加宏大的layer2叙事板块，以太坊的后续潜在可能性不容低估。\n\n相信以太坊，是对以太坊多年稳固共识的敬畏，也是对其背后庞大开发者群体Builder的Respect。\n\n依稀记得18年岁末，EOS号称全新范式公链，且掀起了一轮菠菜游戏狂潮，但事实结果大家都看到了，短暂繁华散尽后，最终还是慢却稳健的以太坊笑到了最后。\n\n真正的价值发现，一定得慢慢Capture捕捉。\n\n3）Layer2在熊市的Build速度确实慢了，尤其是没有一轮layer2 Summer的市场大馈赠，让参与layer2生态构建的每个人都有点心有不甘。\n\n不过， layer2 Build速度过慢和以太坊DeFi叙事溢出到各大新锐公链另立山头道理类似。 以太坊layer2的后半程要靠一些高频交易和应用驱动，单靠以太坊金融玩法的溢出效应和路径依赖，和Alt-layer1硬碰硬对抗并没有优势。\n\n一方面，Arbitrum、Optimism等OP-Rollup有了layer2先发生态优势，并在Stack战略下，扩大了市场疆域，但这些战略扩张到底属于B端布局，OP-Rollup需要解决被诟病的中心化难题且带动C端市场增长。\n\n另一方面，zkSync、Starknet等ZK-Rollup有更Advanced技术优势，只不过ZK也是着眼于未来的技术，已有用户量级无法充分显现ZK的强大之处。只有用户量级扩大，Gas才能低到忽略不计，体验也越丝滑，这才是ZK layer2的最终形态。\n\n此外，layer2市场腰尾部力量正在举事，比如，Metis，尝试用Hyper（OP+ZK）Rollup技术，做POS去中心化Sequencer，变革Token的激励方式（治理—>实用）等等。还有，Espresso、Astria等共享Sequencer方案，也在以Rollup as a Service的方式也不断外延layer2市场的潜能。\n\n别以为OP+ZK就已经把layer2的故事讲完了，在我看来，Layer2 War才真正开始，真正内卷的layer2市场坎昆升级后可能才拉开局面。当坎昆升级时间敲定后，layer2的抱团逆势上涨不正是对眼下layer2憋屈处境的一次情绪释放？\n\n当未来应用链叙事场景打开，Mass Adoption的局面被打开后，layer2赛道能沉淀的资金、用户和DApp应用，一定比其他Alt-layer1更稳固。\n\n4）当然，此刻为以太坊生态发声，并非否定Solana的市场潜力。不可否认，Solana的技术创新起点确实高于已有区块链架构，无论是它的存储和计算分离特性以及高并发交易处理特性，都使得它对用户很友好，更容易打造生态。\n\n以DePin为例，物理基础设施+Token代币激励，这是过去一直在失败漩涡中反复的叙事，比如Filecoin Arweave等。在Solana上会不会真正成功，我不知道，但DePin发生在Solana上，我对DePin的信心会多一些。毕竟，高并发的技术起点和web2天然接轨，这和靠模块组合并入的生态逻辑还不一样。\n\nSolana眼下的崛起，一方面是以太坊layer2短暂沉寂带来的空窗机会，另一方面则是Solana上本来就活跃着一批开发力量的结果。但需要纠正的是，Solana的目标并非杀死以太坊，它其实在找以太坊的“空白”点伺机突破，如果有所建树且有于以太坊匹配的生态当量，顶多也就是比肩而已，何来取代一说。\n\n以太坊不可避免的会被一些全新技术起点的Alt-layer1链冲击，但他们都不是以太坊“杀手”，我更倾向于称之为，web3破局创新者。\n\n以太坊在DeFi金融应用以及庞大的组合性生态已经获得了成功，而layer2、layer3未来的新征途还正在路上。\n\n如果“开放、包容、可信、组合”，这样的以太坊最终都成就不了区块链价值落地，我很难相信一个新链就会。\n\nNote：若认同我的思考，喜欢我文章的话，帮忙一键三连下，谢谢大家支持。"

            "full_text": "近期， @zksync  完成了Boojum升级，也正是基于此前提，zkSync才抗住了SYNC铭文行动的压力测试。不过， Boojum却被市场低估了。\n\nBoojum到底带来了哪些性能提升？被诟病的DeFi稳定性问题能解决吗？接下来，谈谈我的理解：\n\n1）Boojum升级，简单理解，会让zkSync完成SNARK向STARK证明的过渡。工作流程大致如下：\n\n当一个Batch封装完成后，这些交易会被分解成多个特定电路，然后并行高速处理生成大量STARKs，最后被聚合成一个STARK证明。最后再把该STARK证明封装成一个SNARK证明中，并提交到主网进行验证。\n\n这样混合使用STARK和SNARK，既确保了能高效处理大量交易，同时又降低了提交到主网的数据大小（SNARK较简洁），与主网更加兼容。\n\n而同时采用两项证明方式，意味着其Prover系统的高级压缩技术、硬件加速技术、算法优化、批量处理聚合效率、内存和存储优化等都会有重大性能提升；\n\n2）据 @0xtaetaehoho  推文中的阐述，Boojum更新前平均每笔交易数据量为211bytes，而升级后可以减少到大约68bytes，压缩技术的提升会直接大幅提升layer2每笔Batch的交易量，进而使得TPS大幅提升（450左右），同时单笔交易均摊的Gas成本降低（65%左右）。\n\n原理不难理解，layer2向主网calldata提交状态证明数据，由于主网存储数据有限，layer2的STARK并行处理能力和SNARK证明压缩处理技术决定了单次Batch可处理的交易量以及Gas水平；\n\n3）而之前ZK-Rollup在处理较低频DeFi交易时存在不稳定性问题，它的原生倾向性不利于DeFi稳定。比如DeFi多变的价格需要多个Oracle喂价，如果两笔交易没有被Batch到同一个状态下，产生的交易磨损就会增大。\n\n现在layer2单笔Batch的交易量大幅提升了，区块内可容纳更多的Oracle数据状态更新。DeFi稳定性问题也会得到有效解决。\n\n恰如zkSync官方 @anthonykrose  所言，无论一个区块内包含多少个预言机更新，整个区块状态可以被作为一个整体来处理和记录，且只需要支付一次状态写入的成本。这对于DeFi 应用在ZK-Rollup链上的低费率、高效率和稳定性都大有裨益。\n\n按理说，Boojum的升级应该算zkSync里程碑式的进步。\n\n一方面验证了ZK系统交易量级越大，Gas费越低体验越好的推论，另一方面也证明了链下Prover系统的压缩技术、硬件加速等计算资源的高效应用和性能提升，会给ZK系统带来无穷的想象空间。\n\n大家都在期待坎昆升级后以太坊主网Blob区块容量能降低layer2 Batch交易的成本，而今ZK系统自身的技术优化已经把ZK系Rollup和OP系Rollup拉到了同一条水平线。\n\n关键是，ZK-Rollup要比OP-Rollup“主动”多了。一直叙事的ZK-Rollup技术优势，在Boojum升级后得到了充分证明。\n\nReference：关于ZK硬件加速、算力优化等内容相对抽象，具体可参看以下研报：\n\nhttps://t.co/V4hexe7CTd"

            "full_text": "在zkSync链上刻铭文，短时涌入的天量交易，确实是一次layer2公链性能的“压力测试”，不过结果并非“宕机”，恰恰相反，这是一次 @zksync  的公开练兵，结果是TPS峰值、GAS稳定性等都完美经受了考验。\n\n乍一听，是不是有点反直觉？接下来，用技术逻辑，我来给大家澄清一下：\n\nzkSync打包出块的工作原理，简单而言：用户构造交易进入zkSync Sequencer的排序序列，然后Sequencer根据Gas Fee高低排序打包进区块，然后再把区块传入Proof系统验证，最后Submit到主网完成finality状态确认。\n\n-这里边有2个关键点，容易制造“体验糟糕”假象：\n\n1）用户构造交易环节:大部分用户都会通过Metamask等钱包端发起交易，而通过钱包端向zkSync发交易，交易会先进入RPC远程调用服务器里，然后Sequencer接收这些交易进入排队序列。这里的排队时间短则几秒，长则几分钟，人如果等待时间较长，MetaMask就会认定该笔交易已经失败，然后前端返回交易失败的提示。\n\n然而，这并不意味着交易真失败了，而只是因为Metamask的RPC响应时间和反馈逻辑和zkSync的Sequencer排队打包交易逻辑存在“不兼容”所致。这正是为何，一些明明MetaMask显示失败的交易，在等待一段时间后，后端服务器显示又成功的原因。\n\n如果用户不走钱包管道，直接使用后端代码调用zkSync的RPC，就不会存在响应时间超时以及提示失败的问题，体验相对而言会很丝滑。这确实会让一些可使用后端代码指令的“科学家”取得了优势，但本质上属于钱包体验端的问题，和zkSync链的处理能力无关。\n\n2）Sequencer公平排序环节：当用户短时向RPC队列发出交易时，每一笔交易都会从nonce值为0开始叠加，如果上一笔交易还在排队状态，nonce为0，这时用户又发起了一笔新交易nonce为1，zkSync的Sequencer会根据time来给这些交易分配nonce，然后按照顺序排序。\n\n但倘若，用户在MetaMask前段看到上一笔交易显示失败后，同时又提交新的交易，很可能新提交的交易由于钱包端和zkSync API接口调用的问题，有一部分交易最终并没有成功提交到RPC的排队序列中。用户以为提交了很多交易，实际上zkSync只收到了其中一部分，而只要他们收到就会去排序处理。\n\n这么看，用户看到MetaMask反馈交易失败，不停提交新交易的行为也会造成大量交易失败，因为根本就没有提交到zkSync链的后端，只是你在前端以为自己提交了。\n\n整体而言，MetaMask钱包的RPC响应时间逻辑问题和用户着急向链上叠加交易的行为，都会造成大量的交易“失败”，如果清楚zkSync的后台交易处理工作流程的话，相对更容易避开这些优化体验问题。\n\n-基于以上科普，再来澄清下“宕机”问题：\n\nzkSync链并未“宕机”，只是浏览器前端显示问题，因为浏览器会通过zkSync的RPC接口拉取最新数据，但是接口响应会有延迟，大量新交易会使响应变慢。\n\n总之，浏览器的拉取数据同步速度跟不上排队交易激增的速度，这是浏览器前端的问题，与链的运转没有关系。通常等交易速度适当放缓，浏览器可以抓取到新数据后，问题就会解决。\n\n当遇到浏览器不work的时候，可以通过其他同步zkSync区块数据信息的浏览器来交叉验证，比如： https://t.co/vcUbhjsQcW\n\n-真实链的“运转性能”情况如何呢？\n\n1）在所谓宕机传闻爆出后，zkSync的官方工作人员 @anthonykrose  在推特却频频发出TPS刷新捷报。实际上，zkSync TPS飙到了187.9的峰值，正常情况下，TPS只有50-100左右，这说明大量的新交易涌入，zkSync其实抗住了压力。这确实也给未来数千甚至上万的TPS做了一次充分的“压力测试”。\n\n2）ZK-Rollup的特殊机制决定了，处理的交易量越大，Gas费则越便宜，事实上，zkSync的Gas费确实更加便宜了，因为交易成本也被分摊了，根据growthepie数据显示，近24小时，zkSync的Gas平均值还降低了5.2%，平均在$0.19左右，这个数据每个人的体验可能不一样，但综合链的运行数据，确实是便宜了。佐证了ZK-Rollup的更流畅体验需要将现有的用户规模提升一个量级。\n\n-铭文事件对layer2公链的影响？\n\n根据dune数据显示， Sync的铭文铸造，14个小时新增了5M笔交易，已有65575个Holder参加。诚如上述所言，zkSync官方已经知道了这场社区发起的“压力测试”活动，还紧急采取措施来确保zkSync链的有序进行。\n\n这个数据对zkSync而言确实是一次较好的压力测试实验，其正向影响大于负面。长远看，铭文事件并非传言中把layer2性能打回了原型，反倒给layer2的进一步性能优化提供了实践经验。\n\n不过据我了解，除了Sync之外，还有其他铭文正在铸造，虽不及Sync那么fomo，但也给此压力测试添了一把火。\n\nAnyway，结果总体而言是好的，大家若厘清zkSync后台排序出块的技术逻辑，再拨开其中存在的“体验糟糕”误会，就应该懂得，一切运行安好，我们得给layer2多一点信心。"

            "full_text": "之前多篇文章阐述了，OP-Rollup和ZK-Rollup都在去中心化Sequencer问题上停滞不前，是不是意味着去中心化Sequencer就彻底无解了？\n\n带着这个疑问，研究了下 @MetisDAO ，号称构建了第一个去中心化排序器的layer2项目。发现Sequencer去中心化技术逻辑并不难，难的是“权利下放”。\n\n采用“硬分布式”技术共识和“软分布式”社会共识的Sequencer方案，似乎都Make Sense，但会有完全不一样的End Game！Why？\n\n在以太坊主网上，用户提交交易到Mempool，由Searcher搜集交易广播出去最终由矿工Builder按GAS高低排序完成打包出块。这意味着，你提交的交易可能被MEV，且需要遵循Nounce排队机制，付出的Gas是EVM执行操作所需的费用，结果导致在主网上发交易又贵、又慢还容易被夹。\n\n类比看，Layer2的Sequencer就是一个封闭的Mempool，用户把交易提交给Sequencer，Sequencer负责排序并把交易集中Batch成一个区块最终提交到主网。这使得，layer2的交易排序完全由Sequencer说了算，且没有nounce值排队一说，付出的Gas是同一批Batch交易的均摊费用。\n\n这样的话，layer2交易快且便宜，理论上，Sequencer收到交易后会按照交易Nonce、接收时间、Gas价格、或者随机的算法公平排序。但由于Sequencer权利过大，会不会搞MEV，是否插入恶意交易等得打个问号？\n\n目前Rollup市场主流的方案，是一种默认Sequencer是中心化但却值得“乐观”的解决方案。\n\n一方面因为Sequencer属于layer2的核心组件，一开始若就采用分布式Sequencer潜在的故障风险会影响用户体验，所以大多数项目方，早期倾向于中心化运维，来确保安全和稳定；\n\n另一方面，当该项目成长到一定程度，处理大量交易需求时，就用了至高无上的权利，不仅可以控制Gas定价权还能直接抽水盈利，这时市场已经大到一定规模，就不太愿意再推行去中心化把权利拱手相让了。layer2四大天王Sequencer去中心化进程慢的原因正是如此。\n\n不过，他们都不约而同选择了Stack的战略架构。这是一种把核心技术代码开源，并试图将关键技术组件共享化的战略方案。\n\n通过把核心Sequencer共享出去，打造一个Superchain多链组合架构，然后通过MPC多签，治理权投票等方式来共同治理，达成了一种社会化的“透明、分散”共识，好比山大王封了老二老三老四几个管理坐席，但遇重大决策，咱还得唯老大哥马首是瞻不是？\n\n这类软分布式Sequencer方案，立足高远，适合市场大到一定规模，大家对权利中心取得绝对信任，且对一些信任摩擦问题（作恶、挑战）等脱敏了的前提，比如OP Stack。\n\n@MetisDAO  提供的去中心化Sequencer方案怎么回事呢？\n\n简单来说，是一种搭建分布式Sequencer节点的“硬分布式”方案。\n\nlayer2的多个Sequencer节点会组成一个排序器池，排序器只有抵押2万个Metis代币才有资格拥有出块权，用户还可以以Staking的形式选择相应的Sequencer节点，这样Sequencer出块挖矿会获得大量代币激励，用户Staking也能共享Reward。\n\n此外为了防止Sequencer存在作恶行为，Metis引入了L2 Rangers，用来对区块进行抽样，并根据其原始的State状态根来进行对比验证，包括交易的次序有没被调换，有没有恶意交易插入等等。本身该验证行为也可以获得挖矿奖励，一旦发现Sequencer作恶，系统会对作恶节点质押的资产进行Slash，验证节点还能分得一部分罚没的资产。\n\nSequencer想要获得激励就会加入POS权益队列，Verifier挖矿也会加强抽样验证工作，通过这种激励和惩罚模型就串起来一个work的去中心化Sequencer系统。\n\n这种“硬分布式”的架构，Sequencer由多主体运行，且有透明的奖罚机制存在，也是一种约束Sequencer个体权利，确保公平排序的有效方式。\n\n以上\n\n软分布式和硬分布式本质上都是一种战略手段。\n\nStack开源框架更适用于Monolithic大主体版图扩张，较为依赖主体的市场地位、品牌威望等无形信任资产；POS去中心化Sequencer相对更适用于modular小主体弯道超车，毕竟区块链沉淀下来最有力的共识就是节点挖矿技术共识模式。\n\n在 Rollup As A Service 的layer2市场局势下，Stack框架会降低项目方开发layer2的成本，但其累积下的“信任”问题要寄托在所有参与者一起清偿。\n\n而直接硬分布式的技术共识，在Sequencer的问题上边界清晰一些，更适用于在整体layer2 技术进展缓慢，舆论风评拉跨的背景下，可以有一个更引人瞩目的起点和发展预期。\n\n当然，我也看了下 @EspressoSys ，@AstriaOrg  ，@radius_xyz   等其他去中心化Sequencer技术共识方案。\n\n和Metis的逻辑也类似，把单一的Sequencer设计成多主体，只不过在涉及这部分链外共识时，Esprsso采用Eigenlayer基于Restaking延伸了以太坊Validators的验证能力；\n\nAstria则采用更模块化的方式，给layer2开发者提供了快速模块化Sequencer方案；\n\nRadius则采用了给所有入Sequencer池交易加密的方式杜绝了作恶和MEV风险。（找机会展开分析）\n\n总之，我的观点：Sequencer的去中心化问题，并不会止步于Layerr2四大天王的Stack战略，技术共识的去中心化方案虽然确实有共识过载的风险，但相比MPC多签治理社会共识那套相比会更有前景。"

            "full_text": "都在盼望 @Starknet 发空投能给Layer2行业注入一针强心剂，发多少，怎么发？还不明确，不过有一点很肯定，ZK-Rollup梯队到了不得不发空投“救市”的时候了。\n\n在我看来，这一波空投catalyst将会是ZK-Rollup的一次自我救赎行动。Why？\n\n1）都说ZK-Rollup是layer2 Rollup的方案的终局，在ZK-Rollup面前，OP-Rollup就是过渡方案，迟早要被淘汰。\n就绝对技术而言，围绕OP-Rollup和ZK-Rollup孰优孰劣的论战已经持续了太久。\n\nFinality  Proof 以每笔交易给确定状态相比Fraud Proof存在的7天乐观挑战期，从个人Sovereign主义的视角来看，Rollup的未来一定是ZK-Rollup，毋庸置疑。\n\n据L2Beat数据显示，65个Rollup项目中有26个ZK-Rollup方案，而同比之下，OP-Rollup只有21个。\n\n这些ZK-Rollup方案中，Scroll、Taiko等追求极致EVM等效性，旨在提升与以太坊主网的兼容性；zkSync、Starknet则追求链的综合扩展能力，试图通过提升交易处理速度和吞吐量为主网提升增量用户；Aztec则专注于通过ZK解决交易隐私问题；其余像dYdX、zkSYnc Lite则在交易和Payment方向挖掘ZK技术的潜能。\n\n整体而言，ZK-Rollup技术越来越细分，开始过度追求细节以达成更极致的技术叙事：比如严苛的电路效率和完全的EVM等效性。追求极致技术并没有错，但别忘了ZK本身就属于技术高门槛，过度追求技术会让团队忽略用户体验，忽略ZK是要来解决实用问题的初衷。\n\n这不单纯是我的观察，而且切切实实来自市场的真实声音，对ZK-Rollup项目方而言，应该平衡技术追求和实际市场需求，以提升ZK技术的可落地性和高用户体验为目标，切莫沉浸在to VC的技术叙事中自我感动（不点名了）。\n\n2）虽然Starknet的空投发放标准还不明确，但其发空投价值导向和目的已尽人皆知了，比如，分发STRK给DApp开发者以激励他们build项目；分发STRK给ECMP早期社区贡献者（contents、meetups、workshops等），分发9亿STRK用于未来用户返利等等。\n\n不难看出，Starknet的空投发放会在意个体的贡献和价值，此外更看重空投长期的生态激励 效果。因此，我判断STRK空投规模一定会达到大部分人的“爽点”，这是激发大家持续往ZK-Rollup贡献热情的开关，此外，大部分代币会通过Paymaster和Transaction绑定，在未来的生态贡献中作为GAS费补贴同时会线性释放。\n\n看看Starknet名不副实的灾难级TVL数据以及拉跨的用户交易体验，就一定懂得，为什么需要搞交易返利了？虽然撸毛党们已经早期贡献了大量的TXS，但还不够，索性明牌做返利，你们接着来刷吧，最好猛烈一点。\n\n毕竟撸毛党的贡献也是实实在在的。这似乎意味着，追溯性的空投或许会弱于未来潜在性的空投，Starknet的空投激励游戏才开始上演，不可能让你们上来就分食蛋糕后一哄而散。\n\nTokenomics是把双刃剑，像Starknet这种论团队、背后资本、技术都根正苗红的项目方，轻易不会动用Tokenomics这把利器，历史上不乏有发完空投热闹一场后生态就变荒寂的先例，对于ZK这种技术门槛高，用户体验差的生态更是挑战。\n\n但面对眼下的惨淡的生态现状，除了Tokenomics这最后的底牌，ZK-Rollup的故事还能怎么续写？"

            "full_text": "系统研究了下 @ParticleNtwrk 的B2B2C全局产品架构，涉及Intent Fusion框架，隐私zkStack等关键组件。 他们定义这套执行环境为Access Layer，试图解决用户在web3体验上的高门槛问题。\n\n不夸张说，前有Account Abstraction，后有Intent-Centric，整个EVM账户抽象赛道都在铆足劲还以太坊的“技术债”，仅一个EOA地址的替代问题，就涌现出了千人前面的各类钱包解决方案。\n \n应该说，以太坊账户抽象的生态呈现分裂和碎片化现状，不同的项目，不同的方案，但却没有统一的标准，尽管ERC4337本身就属于标准，但这类EIP标准只能实现代码工程层面的规范，落实到具体的钱包开发者，DApp应用开发者头上，还是会存在个性化体验差异。\n\n这正是，B2B2C这套web3特效疗药模式的由来。那么，技术视角看，Particle Network是如何给B端规范开发标准的呢？\n\n总的来说，Particle认识到，基于用户本位彻底改变用户体验，就得从钱包开发层到不同链和协议兼容通信层，再到DeFi生态流动性管理市场层，都得做一条龙设计优化，甚至得重造炉台：\n\n-模块化智能钱包即服务（WaaS）：\n \n对B端应用而言，痛点在于短时集成一整套的标准化基础框架方案，比如隐私问题、社交登陆、AA账户抽象问题、不同链兼容问题等。对C端用户而言，使用钱包的痛点无非有二：1）降低登陆门槛；2）增强隐私保护；\n \n这套Wass服务，向B端开发者提供了一套嵌入式钱包的开发框架，DApp开发者可以按统一规范和标准，低成本开发自己的钱包，其实也可以或缺更广泛的用户流量。\n\n为了让这套钱包标准不至于很被动，Particle设计了Social login和隐私保护两套C端用户抓手服务：\n\n其中社交登陆采用了OAuth开放标准，可以基于Twitter、Facebook等社交平台身份来登陆新DApp应用，此外还有一套JWT（JSON web令牌）标准，可用于生成临时密钥对，可以在两个parties之间安全传输信息，因此可以避免服务器端直接存储用户的账户密码。\n \n一直以来钱包为了个性化服务，在解决隐私问题是提供了各种花样的方案，结果是非但没吸引到用户，反倒增加了信任门槛。\n\nParticle的标准化方案可以降低新用户使用DApp应用的门槛，同时临时私钥则保护了真实私钥安全，JWT还能约定一个有效expire的访问期限，可整体提升钱包使用体验。\n\n而且集成这项服务的DApp越多，就意味着Particle的上游用户群体基数越庞大，这会为其下游的其他服务提供流量基础。\n \n-隐私交易（Coinfidential zkStack）：\n \n之前Vitalik参投的Noctrune采用的方案是生成临时Sleuth地址，还有一种方案是，构建了类似Tornado的隐私交易池，用户向多签控制的平台地址Deposit，然后平台地址和合约的Pool之间用混币方式打乱交易顺序和量，实现混币效果。\n\n总之要想保护用户的隐私，就得隐藏用户发起交易的From地址。Particle选择延展账户抽象中的Paymaster的代付功能，不仅用Paymaster来支付Gas，用户的转账资产也由Paymaster来直接完成，这就实现了真实From地址的隐藏。\n \n不过，这种隐藏并不彻底，于是又让整个过程ZK化，利用zk-SNARKs的隐私性，用户可以在不透露真实地址的情况下和Paymaster代付地址进行交互，甚至没办法反向推断出真实地址。\n \n-Particle Chain（zkEVM）\n \n为了支撑整个运转框架，Particle组建了一个独立的zkEVM链，它并非传统以太坊layer2的概念，而更像是整个Access Layer的中控台；\n\n1）数据可用性DA层，从多个DApp应用，甚至多个链来的用户，只要采用了Particle的统一钱包服务标准，就会在此zkEVM链上有统一的身份和资产管理体验；\n\n2）多链Interoperability，在Ominichain账户抽象框架中，用户以统一身份和各个链交互，就必须具备实时各个链的合约结算能力；\n\n3）为了确保全过程的去中心化和隐私保护特性，用户的隐私信息由Particle上的Validators来进行验证；\n\n4）链有统一的Token来作为Gas燃料，可以用在不同链交易损耗的Gas补贴，也可以用来独立链处理交易的手续费。\n \n整体来说，这条zkEVM链更像是一个抽象专属链，而并没有加入以太坊layer2的梯队，虽然后者可能会让叙事更容易，但作为独立链才能抽离出以太坊的局限控制，从更高的维度解决以太坊EVM生态内千人千面的离散局面。\n \n-分布式Solver网络（Intent Fusion Protocol）\n \n在intent-centric架构中，去中心化Solver网络为核心，何为Solver？就是来提供一些抽象需求解决方案的Provider。\n\n现在纯EVM环境也有各色各样的Solver，不过它们属于uniswapX，属于1inch，可实现的抽象需求也就限于抗MEV，免Gas这些，用户设想的需求比如某个时间段选取滑点最低的时间点来执行多步骤操作，这类有点“智能”特性的需求，显然是现有的EVM Solver框架很难解决的。\n\n因为并没有一个统一提供激励和入口的市场，Solver看不到用户更多的需求，也没必要去克服这些难办的需求。\n \nParticle要做的Fusion目的正是把这些群龙无首的Solver市场统一起来，给他们提供激励来丰富用户可享受的“intent”抽象服务类型。这正是Particle做Fusion统一激励网络的初衷。 \n\n以上\n \n很长一段时间，开发者用不同的方式来给“EVM打补丁”，其实是费大劲在补以太坊的“技术债”，补来补去还不见得能补好。如果组一个大局，来统一规范这个千人千面的市场，情况或许会大不一样了。\n\n这个Access Layer也是一个开放网络的访问层，在行业早期，市场缺乏统一标准还容易理解，但当一个行业想突破Mass Adoption限制，用户从1亿向10亿扩张的同时，B端的开发能力、标准和体验就成了一切问题的关键。"

            "full_text": "2023年总结：避开12月31号高峰，我就提前发出来了\n\n一：冲的一些项目\n在2022年底的时候，总以为2023会复刻2019年，历史往往相似，但并不是一模一样，回看下来没想到2023能这么好，有这么多机会，以下总结下这一年冲的项目，当然，项目太多了，就重点挑几个说\n\n1：猴卡\n在2023春节过节回家的当天凌晨上架的os，然后在1.1e左右上车，在2.3e持续加仓，并且买入了排名前500的nft，具体价格忘了，应该是10e左右我记得，这期间不断的打游戏，冲进前500，最后在卡片变成盒子后的阶段全部卖出，基本上e本位亏损了40%左右，好在前500的稀有nft原价卖出了。\n\n这个算是亏损的比较多的一个项目吧，这个项目是真的体现了一个道理，最好的故事杀最多的人，虽然说亏了点钱，但是好在涨了经验\n\n2：bnb/btc汇率和eth/btc汇率，以及bnb/eth汇率\n这个是今年亏损最多的操作，把bnb全部换没了，而且在高位把btc换成了eth，最后算账的时候发现，自己在大饼本位亏了3个大饼左右，如果按照今天的价格来看，基本上13万刀左右吧。\n\n按照币本位来看，这是亏损的最多的一次，在这次的操作中我学到了：不要再做什么汇率交易了，我确实不擅长交易，不断的折腾只能把大饼玩的越来越少，大仓位就配置好，配置好那些可以长期持有的资产，不动就好了，剩下的仓位再折腾，大仓位的缩水还是比较难受的。\n\n3：blur空投\nblur的空投算是彻底改变当时市场的空投格局，我其实开始没太当回事，但是本着防身的态度还是刷了一些，最后拿到了将近3万个blur，在2.4u卖出了，当时是犹豫了下，不然能多卖几倍。\n\n这个也是我运气好，在充值OK的时候没有卡我，让我顺利的卖出。\n\n但是我在0.77的时候，把所有的blur全部买了回来，在0.5左右又全部卖出了，也算是一个比较韭菜的操作。\n\n在年底又在0.3几又买了几万个blur，现在锁在了blur里面，等着明年看看，反正这部分也是长期持有的，就锁在里面了，看看明年是否有福报吧。\n\n4：arb空投\narb的空投算是在能力范围内的一次操作吧，从没发币的时候我就做了教程，根据op的规则来预测发币的规则，从结果来看这确实是我做的比较好的一次，这是2022年5月我写的教程：https://t.co/paEfEm6Uc0 《arbitrum空投教程》\n但是当时的我从没想过能在一个项目上赚到百万以上，所以刷的就不多，这是当时的复盘：https://t.co/CDYR7GBJxE 《arbitrum空投复盘》\n\n最后才拿到了5万多个arb，在1.4u基本上都卖掉了，虽然说当时知道arb能赚，但是从没想过能在一个项目赚钱超过百万甚至千万，觉得转个大几万u就很不错了，虽然说赚了大概七八万刀吧，但是感觉自己在这个项目上是可以做的更好的。\n\n5：sui打新\n这也是一个大项目，但是自己做的不是很好，有很多原因吧，当时弄了250个kucoin，然后最后投入的时候因为卡点投入一个都没快照上，而且OK这边在OKB投入的时候因为当时在外地，所以也没注意wif的事情，所以导致最后只有三分之一的中奖率。\n\n这个项目让我难受了很久，几乎是必赚百万甚至千万以上的机会，但是由于很多原因操作失败了，具体的复盘可以看：https://t.co/pRr5gfNEAd\n\n这个项目真的难受了很久，但是最后也是因祸得福，借着这个机会，组成了现在的团队\n\n6：ZK/STARK空投\n这是今年花费时间最多，上的仓位比较大的项目，我们大概上了大几千个吧，从研究op和arb的规则开始，到测试每个钱包做到精品号的成本，各个协议怎么大额交互，如何批量管理大量的账户，人工执行和程序执行的各种细节，如何省钱，以及如何维护等待，这是今年花费精力最大的项目。\n\n虽然说没发币，但是我对这部分的流程算是比较满意的，因为这是我们第一次去管理，操作如此大量的账户，并且整个流程下来后，我们对批量管理大量钱包地址的经验有了一些不一样的体会。\n\n因为之前有过arb的经验，所以我想在zk做到知行合一，所以下重仓去做，至于最后能否拿到结果那就看天了，我只能把过程做到最好，更多的追求过程正确，从过程来看这确实是我们团队做的不错的项目。\n\n7：BTC生态\n其实在今年2月份我就开始用麻雀钱包打btc的punk了，但是一直有偏见，觉得没啥发展，直到最后的7-8月份才重新把注意力拉回来到btc生态。\n\nbtc生态抓的也不是特别好吧，从osh，-tap开始，开始打协议头矿，但是eths和sols等等没打上，在pipe的时候我们团队打了1700张左右，但是在25u清仓了，之前在推特写过，现在应该卖飞了1000万美金了，这是我们第一次错过了这么大的财富，当时的思维还是停留在熊市，觉得有点利润就套利出货了。\n\nmubi是我们错过的第二大项目，当时拿到了9张吧，一张75万个，然后拿到现在应该也1000万人民币了，但是这次好在没有全都卖，还是有个十几万美金在车上。\n\n从这两个项目的结果来看，我的思考是，牛市确实要敢冲，要敢于让自己赚大钱，而不是光赚小钱，不要总想着逃套利，要学会下注，学会下注才能赚大钱。\n\n8：其他项目\n其他也陆陆续续搞了很多项目，太多了数不过来了，也是陆陆续续能赚个几千刀这种，并不多，还是要学会怎么赚大钱是最重要的。\n\n二：遇见了一些贵人，也产生了一些合作\n从今年年初开始就拜访各个朋友，和一些优秀的朋友产生了一些链接。\n当时专门拜访了冰蛙@Ice_Frog666666 蛙总，学习到了很多关于创业的经验，从蛙总身上学到的东西确实让我少走了很多弯路，无论是对成本的思考还是对项目的西靠，对我这个刚组团队的小白提供了很多帮助。\n\n也和小人物@MetaHunter168产生了多次交流，和蛙总一样，物总也是一个充满智慧的人，对于创业，做项目，都有给我很多帮助。\n\n也感谢七爷@qiye_7777，很感谢七爷组织活动，才有了我们的团队，今年也在七爷的团队工作了一段时间，产生了一些链接，和这种优秀的团队一起工作收获是非常大的，不仅近距离看到了一个优秀团队是怎么运作的，也从中学到了很多关于团队的经验。\n\n还有超级老师@Super4DeFi，今年本末组织的活动基本都参加了，认识了一些套利大佬，拓展了见识，而且也和超级老师产生了一点点的合作，很高兴能给超级老师提供价值。\n\n最后还有sally姐，在投研方面，我从sally姐身上学到了非常多，算是我在投研领域的一个非常优秀的老师吧，从年初刚刚认识，到现在也产生了一点合作，能给这样优秀的朋友提供一些价值还是很开心的。\n\n还有我的邻居ad，今年也是多次来我们办公室，我们聊了很多关于机构投资的视角，给我了一些更高层的视角去看待项目。很感谢能有这样一个朋友。\n\n三：做了一些事情\n今年我的社群的教程已经突破了100篇，视频➕直播回放也超过30个，尽可能的在每一次的热点给群友直播，在空投相关领域多次给群友直播分享我的见解。\n\n组织了社群的线下活动，将近50人来到线下，我们近距离的链接，并且也让群友们更好的互相认识，也算是创造了一些价值。\n\n我个人觉得我的社群交付还是可以的，并且价格也不高，算是比较划得来的了，在来年也会对社群进行升级，提供更好的内容和服务。\n\n组成了团队，虽然小伙伴们大家之前都是单打独斗的，到一起后难免也有一些不习惯，但是这段时间以来，我们之间的配合越来越好，解决了各种各样的问题，我非常感谢团队的小伙伴，没有他们也没有我的现在，也无法扩大生产和承接更多的资金，非常感谢团队小伙伴，希望能和你们一起走的更远。\n\n四：经历了一些财富的起起落落和一些体会\n从今年年初算的话，大概亏损也有个100多万了，但是赚回来的更多一些，资产波动比较大，对于大佬来讲不多，但是对我自己来说还是挺多的。\n\n无论是亏了很多钱，还是卖飞了大几千万的pipe和mubi，在经历这些过后，让我能更加平和的去面对自己资产的波动了，对很多简单的道理也有了更加深刻的认知。\n\n当然，之前写过很多我的思考了，这里就不重复了。\n今年给我最深刻体会的思考是：尊重新时代的人和叙事，并且保持开放去了解，曾经赚钱的项目和成功过的人在未来不一定能赚到钱，也不一定能连续成功。\n\n从btc生态来看，其实我开放的程度远远不够，当时还是沉浸在撸毛等项目上，而且也涌入了一批新人，我看着这些新人的财富增长速度如此之快，也发现了开放带来的优点和好处，以及固步自封和倚老卖老的缺点。\n\n当然，下一个叙事不知道是什么，但是争取做到能保持开放的心态登上新叙事和新时代的船，尊重老前辈的同时，更要尊重新人，尊重新叙事，保持开放，是我今年最大的体会。\n\n虽然说今年没什么财富故事，但也是慢慢积累财富的过程吧，可能这就是普通人的一年，就像笑来老师说的，很多事情不是因为不普通才能做到，而是先做到了，才变得不普通。\n\n马上就2024年了，祝大家在新的一年发大财"

            "full_text": "对最近btc生态市场的思考（上）\n\n目前铭文市场从被人看不起的阶段到全民mint铭文的阶段，财富故事一个接一个，大家都冲进了铭文市场，也有不少人赚了很多，很明显btc生态已经变成了一个赛道级别的机会。\n\n但是新生事物即便是在上涨的大周期，可能也会有比较深的回调。\n\n我自己也打了很多的铭文，虽然说卖飞了pipe，没打到sol，bnbs，但是也确实在其他的项目上赚到了一些超额收益，如果仔细想的话，其实目前铭文的流动性是比较堪忧的，毕竟大多数铭文只有场外，上交易所的没几个，即便有超额盈利，想套现也比较难，可能手握筹码的人并不能卖出足够多的筹码。\n\n还有就是，因为打了太多的铭文，并且是用大饼打的，大饼一定会有一些消耗，换成了铭文，这些铭文有的能跑出来，但是也会有一些跑不出来，所以在保证不亏大饼的情况下，去零成本或者是负成本持有铭文，或者是持有一些优质资产就很重要了。\n\n这里的重点不是优质资产，而是零成本或者是负成本，霍华德马克斯在《投资最重要的事》说过一个观点，就是“买好的不如买的好”，大饼以太即便是再优质的资产，如果6.9万梭哈的话也会亏的很惨，但是即便我买了eos，成本在1美元，也能赚点，这里只是举个例子，不是说要去买eos，能赚超额收益的关键不仅仅是资产足够优质就行了，他只是一个条件，你的成本是否足够低，然后才是是否拿得足够久。这三个加在一起才能构成超额收益。\n\n说回来btc生态，现在的生态龙头基本上已经比较明显了，就是ordi和atom，其他的项目也一定有超额收益，但是据我的观察现在有这样几个特质：\n\n第一：持有筹码的人即便想套现没有足够的流动性\n第二：所有人都冲进来打铭文了，那么如果所有人都赚了钱那要卖给谁？\n第三：市场已经涨了一段时间了，大概率不会一直涨下去\n\n所以我的思考是：\n\n会慢慢的把一些铭文赛道的一些有利润的非龙头资产逐步卖出，留一点点底仓后换成大饼或者是现金，继续定投，或者是换成一些赛道的龙头，比如ordi和atom。\n\n你说我会卖飞吗，一定会的，但是我个人觉得按照资产的比例去分配比按照绝对值去分配更科学。\n\n假设我有100万，我50%大饼，30%eth，剩下的是ordi等等赛道龙头，和我有100万，80%是ordi，剩下的是其他铭文，哪一种会更“科学”一点，我个人觉得是第一种。\n\n当然，我不一定是对的，但是如果赚到的超额收益不能及时套现的话，可能会迎来大幅回撤，当然也有可能超额收益变成了更超额的收益。正如我前面说的我不一定是对的。\n\n我觉得我可能抓不到那些非常超额的收益，但是慢慢变富是可以的，我能接受。这里并不是说我不去研究阿尔法收益的项目了，而是在保住自己的beta收益的同时，不要让自己的资产大幅回撤的情况下，去研究阿尔法收益，如果赚到了超额收益，也练习着去变现一些。\n\n会想上一轮牛市的超额收益也有很多，比如moonbrid，猴地，甚至是猴子本身，还有stepn，都是非常好赚取超额收益的项目，但是赚到大钱且保住收益的并不多，都是经历的山顶过后下来才明白要卖出。\n\n这里指的不是说我有点利润就卖了，而是说，在真的有超额收益的时候，可以练习着去卖一部分出来，变成本金，然后再去等待也好，寻找新的机会也好，毕竟利润也是本金。\n\n所以我自己现在在慢慢的出一些铭文和brc20代币，如果有新项目还是会参与，但是不会大仓位参与，努力做到零成本或者是负成本持有优质资产，然后拿到大饼破前高的大牛市。"

Solana区块链平均每400毫秒产生一个区块\n\n2. 如果在每个区块中只选择一个有效的铸造请求，那么铸造一个完整的10,000个NFT系列大约需要1小时30分钟。\n\n3. 每个区块都有一个独特的标识符，称为区块哈希。这个哈希值在区块确认之前是未知的，因此可以作为一种随机数生成器\n\n4. 选择铸造/交易获胜的方法：\n- 首先，从区块哈希中提取第一个数字（例如\"6MjVseMy2khAe1hXnhwFCMZ6FhzuBpaLaezFYnCxZQuN\"中的6），用来确定获胜的交易。\n- 然后，取出哈希中的所有数字（如6216），检查这些数字是否为偶数，用以确定从哪个方向开始数交易。\n\n5. 具体实施：\n- 如果区块哈希的数字是偶数，就从上往下数；如果是奇数，就反过来数。\n- 按照区块哈希中提取第一个数字6，选取第一个交易包含数字“6”\n\n6. 唯一的作弊方式是在一个区块中进行多个铸造请求，但(0,1)设计的巧思是每次铸造都有成本的，让想包揽整个区块的大户/科学家也可能损失惨重\n\n(0,1)不仅解决公平分配问题，还顺带解决流动性问题\n所有铸造费用会用来对代币/NFT提供流动性。\n- 对于SPL代币，一半供应量给予有效铸造者，另一半用于在AMM上创建流动性\n- 对于NFT系列，所有供应量给予有效铸造者，并用铸造收益建立Bid墙\n\n市值对比\n- Zero (47M) 和 Ordi (1.1B)\n- One (8M) 和 Sols (100M)\n- 即将到来的Meme(?) 和 Silly (86M)\n\n下一个项目时间节点（周六北京时间晚上10点）\n\n1. (0,1) 项目方非常会玩，除了Zero代币以及One NFT资产，项目已经预告会发行Memecoin\n2. 一样是上述提到的公平彩票模式，每次 0.05Sol +1zero，持续铸造的过程会刺激Zero买盘48.5 % 会分给成功铸造用户, 铸造会持续45分钟\n3. 另外One NFT的Holder可以获得3%的Meme代币空投\n\n看到这样公平启动的创新，真的很激动，欢迎补充你看到使用Zero方式发行的协议\n\n加入TG，周六晚上一起打公平发行的Memecoin\nhttps://t.co/uB0u0bwJRK"

"《普通人半年时间，如何用1500美金到A8》——这个市场远比你想象得更有魅力！\n\n2023年是一个魔幻的一年，比特币生态，铭文赛道大爆发，很多千倍万倍币出现，早期参与其中的朋友们也都收获满满，OW也是其中的收益者，2023年即将结束，迎来全新的2024，趁今天做一下年终总结：\n\n我们为什么创建OW品牌？\n\n主要有连续的3个原因，先是我在0.4u附近买入了ordi，隔天晚上unisat市场ordi爆拉从0.4直接拉盘到3-4美金，我立马找到Paul跟他聊聊这个情况，结论是机构入局了，我们意识到btc生态即将拉开帷幕，这是第一点原因\n第二：我的合伙人找到我，决定一起做品牌，取名Ordinals World，寓意包含整个Ordinals生态，但是后面我们决定品牌升级，一致对外统称OW，具体原因下文会提到\n第三，🥚总是最早期建设ordinals的，他对nft和社区文化的理解很深，我们也深受他的影响，于是作为兄弟社区，我们直接使用同样的slogan：Make bitcoin fun again！这句话也是casey创建Ordinals之初的理念，我们很认同，btc之前太无聊了，我们需要新的理念和产品丰富btc生态，让他更有意思更好玩，让btc在全球的采用率进一步提升\n\nOW 踩对的几个关键节点是那些？\n\n1，进入btc生态——兴奋和目标感极强\n5月创建@OrdzWorld 账号，下定决心进入oridnals btc生态\n我负责内容输出，项目投研同时BD，合伙人负责策划，BD，开始启动，OW就从这里开始btc生态之旅\n2，Bitmap出现，开始建设社区——创作灵感很多，经常写文章\n这段时间干了很多事，做了很多尝试，初期其实收获不明显，现在看来当时只是一直在布局，做基本功，但因为早期对这个生态的深度了解和分析，就打了很多btimap\n3，行情清淡，OW品牌升级，投资早期项目——煎熬与机遇\n这段时间市场没流动性，很多项目上线破发，赚钱效应极差，同时我们开始给项目做各类视角的评级，但是明显感觉到好的项目并不多，太少了。于是我们团队开始找出路，想做一次品牌升级，搭建官网，社群，youtube，TG，把我们关注的生态范围扩大，比如以太坊L2，solana等等，同步增加OW Labs基金板块，从VC的视角投资，孵化项目，每天坚持开space，跟其他媒体链接合作和space，线下活动品牌支持等等\n4，参与线下互动，新加坡TOKEN2049等——认识更多优秀的建设者，开发者\n这段时间，我们大部分时间花在跟媒体，交易所，项目的宣发对接中，品牌露出有大家熟悉的链接了Ordinals summit和TOKEN2049，合作且见到了unisat,domo等早期开发者。\n5，力挺以太铭文eths，OW首个提出铭文赛道概念——一路坚守\n在etch几十个粉丝的时候，开始对接etch合作，帮助etch冷启动，打开市场，我们做了很多宣发工作和写了很多文章跟测试教程\n6，市场开始活跃,各种协议层出不穷——继续前行，布局\nOW持续参与打新储备筹码。印象深刻的是这个时候okx最积极布局铭文赛道，提供了高效的基建。bitmap punk炒作，FT的爆火，TOKEN 2049开幕，unisat公布brc20swap利好，父子铭文上线，ordinals铭文突破3000w，domo成立L1 foundation，Geniidata可视化工具上线，eths ESIP-3更新，casey诅咒铭文新提案-ordinals共识破坏危机，蓝盒子发射！atom发射！casey diss brc20并提出runes，pipe发射！。。。\n7，市场更加疯狂，okx成交量暴涨——FOMO\nOW钻石手拿住，持续建设输出。大鹅出生，eths突破1000u，1000倍。atom突破2000美金，500倍。sats耗时6个月终于完成铸造，这是历史上最长时间公平发射。各种brc20，arc20，btc生态的，铭文生态的土狗，动物园开始流行。rcsv重大更新计划bitmap代币化，链上游戏，btc扩容，进一步刺激bitmap地板飙升。atom宣起全节点浪潮，私有节点搭建，备战dmint。eths的facetswap上线，stamp被okx老板奶，2天10倍，ordinals在苏富比拍卖，小狐狸Fuzzy fox出现，cbrc20协议出现，veda比特币虚拟机出现，行情继续暴涨，各协议头部token几乎都ATH，开始很多新项目入场，各种ido流行。unisat支持atomicals协议，atom突破15u，eths被强上交易所突破17u，rcsv品牌升级为bitmap tech，solmap发射，马斯克音乐盒爆火，带动brc420出圈，btc生态总市值突破70亿美金！\n\nOW Labs：那么普通人如何从1500美金到A8？\n\n主要的利润来源：（每一个协议/项目利润均超过A7）\n#ordi 0.3-0.4u购买的ordi，上gate后陆续出了一部分，剩余一直钻石手，我们预计ordi会进入前排行榜前10名\n#bitmap 在早期铸造了大量连号成片5x5，10x10这类的bitmap土地，单张目前价值300u，150倍，目前一块地也没有卖，我们会在下一波大牛市流动性最充足的时候溢价拍卖\n#eths 在以太坊铭文铸造期间，freemint了不少eths，mint成本单张0.8u，单张目前价值1.5万u，18000倍，我们预计eths会进入前排行榜前10名\n#atom atomicals原子协议跟科学家朋友一起打的，也在space公开教大家打atom，目前单张价值1.4万u，2000倍，我们预计atom会进入前排行榜前20名\n#pipe 这个自己打的，也给社区小伙伴做了视频教程，由于录制教程的时间，自己打得不是很多，部分打费了，成本也很低，目前单张3500u\n#goosinals 大鹅打了几批，由于判断失误，卖飞很多，这个也做了教程公开在推特空间，目前单张价值1200u，300倍，我们预计大鹅会成为准蓝筹，关于大鹅的文化，背景，叙事，和全球范围的共识度我们都有在推特介绍\n#brc100 #bos brc100是brc20的扩展协议，目前单张价值2300，500倍。bos是交易市场的平台token目前单张15刀，这个多次在alpha群叫大家打，利润也不错。brc100获得了domo的L1基金公共支持，可以实现btc原生defi，值得期待\n#brc420 #蓝盒子 蓝盒子早期铸造大部分打废，在domo基金公共支持brc420时，我们加仓了，当时价格只有50美金，我们也在社区通知大家买入。目前一个盒子的价格是2.3万美金，50u二级购买的倍数也有460倍，brc420跟bitmap关系非常紧密，目标是打造btc元宇宙，打通btc生态所有资产的发行，铸造和交易，也包括gamefi，跨链，跨设备，跟现实互动的永久访问的比特币元宇宙，我们预计brc420，bitmap的市值会进入加密市值排行榜前10名\n\n辅助的利润来源：\n因为我们后面建了Alpha群，所以参与的项目更频繁，我们OW Labs团队几乎每天都花费超长时间泡在信息流当中，找到赔率高的项目，项目实在比较多所以下罗列一部分战绩不错的，价值较高的项目\n\n#sats sats早期我们没怎么打，后面我们和idclub长期合作，当时搞了一个铸造sats活动，也跟大家抽了奖，基本也快到铸造尾声了大概还剩20%左右，于是最后一段时间参与了sats铸造，但是后面事情的发展超过了我们预期，上币安达到10亿美金市值，涨幅50倍\n#rats #cats 当时在社区给大家讲了个简单的mem逻辑，sats-cats-rats，这个组合很有意思大概率会一起涨，结果是sats rats的涨幅更惊人，cats一直徘徊，mint完直到第二波铭文行情才爆拉，最高市值3000w美金\n#nostrassets 做任务撸空投，这个多劳多得，单号空投track or treat 价值5000u\n跟#unisat #etchmarket #atomicalmarket #geniidata 等等优秀的btc生态基建合作，拿到og\n#avm atomicals原子协议的arc20 avm，avm是原子协议建要做的事情，实现btc原生类智能合约，是atomicals4个主要技术叙事pow，realm，dmint，avm之一，所以meme共识度很高，当时铸造进度4%时候让alpha群的伙伴们打，目前地板300u\n#utxo stamp邮票协议，也在alpha群喊大家打了，stamp是因为luke的出现，裁剪ordinals纷争，okx老板的支持涨起来的，stamp2天10倍，所以stamp市场急一个炒作标的，utxo刚好在stamp更加契合，所以meme属性和共识很强，目前单张地板1500美金\n#piin pi社区的，最高13倍\n#mice 4%进度喊大家打，后面马斯克在推特上喊mice，价格爆拉，至少20倍\n#ordirocks 最高900刀 50倍 这个属于kol带货\n#fuzzyfox 最高800刀 30倍，这个项目发射完后是ordinals og建立了狐朋狗友的社区文化，我们长期看好，公平，公开，包容，文化自信是狐朋狗友的文化符号，我们相信华语ip一定会在btc生态成为准蓝筹\n#fishfaceman 这个当时用wizz新上线的dmint功能打的nft，更快速操作，最高10倍\n#veda 全新的虚拟机赛道，10倍，比较看好，场外继续加了仓\n#solmap 官方刚公布链接10分钟就在alpha群喊大家打了，单张最高90u，成本8u，11倍\n#ratsfriend freemint，单地址利润1300油\n#ThisSongAboutNFTs brc420多次崩溃比较难打，打满一手利润7万u，后面又出了很多假货，idclub保真的链接出来又第一时间发群里叫没打的伙伴赶紧冲，160u到700u，4倍多\n铭文赛道其他链的操作：avav，stxs，neat，波场trxi等等 都有5倍以上的利润，stxs最高30倍\n二级市场操作：stx 1刀进，目前50%，长期看好，stx将在明年升级上面defi会爆发。sol 19美金进入，最高10倍，sol生态活跃度已经超过eth继续看好。mubi 跨链桥项目63sat进场，最高7倍，高控盘\n\n拿住筹码核心逻辑：\n协议/平台级别的筹码选择钻石手，长期持有并参与build；有创新（技术/概念）的单个项目分批出；普通的热点项目（蹭热点/仿盘）直接flip\n\n以上无数的案例，生态，项目一步步验证OW对市场的预知和判断，以及生态大方向的把控，同时也收获了很多人的关注喜欢。这些这里就不详细剖析，大家可以从官推 https://t.co/WPOguOirlS 查看具体的详情进展，感谢感恩支持！\n\n无神论之-失败的案例：\n#oshi 最高达到2000美金，目前100刀，几乎归零，当时很看好btc虚拟机的概念所以拿的筹码多，但是这个项目就完完全全停留在概念，说好公布代码一直延迟，最后由于团队利益问题出现分叉，价格一路下滑，以后没有代码的概念项目谨慎\n#sols 当时看到花花在分享sols铸造，但是后面出现一连串的问题，钱包的sol全部被吞等等bug问题，就没有进一步研究，导致都错过了，后面的事发展得有多疯狂，大家都看到了。\n这里提一下，其实还有一些偷换概念的项目，利用信息差来欺骗市场后来爆火的项目，OW在非常早期就发现，名牌可以拿到很多钱，但基于理念不同坚决不参加。我们坚信市场很大，用心做事布局生态的团队必然能拿到大的结果，道不同不相为谋！\n\n祝福和2024展望\n\n2024我们认为会是波动比较大的一年，但我们对市场保持乐观！铭文赛道，btc生态远还没有达到预计中的体量，所以机会依然很多。\n我们看到越来越多的生态、平台、媒体、项目等参与到这个市场，越来越多的圈外人加入到这个赛道。落后观念的钱会被市场重新瓜分！发现价值，研究价值，和传输价值是OW一直致力于做的事情。\n\n最后祝大家新年快乐！在crypto的投资和建设中持续取得自己想要的结果，同时保持好健康的身体。\n\n我们要的很贵，2024继续努力，保持专注，Keep building! 💪\n\n谢谢你的耐心阅读💗\n\n#ordinals #crypto #Bitcoin"

            "full_text": "铭文 - “大区块主义”的皇帝新衣\n\n熟悉的配方，熟悉的味道。\n\n战火终于还是燃起来了。\n\n2014-2017年，比特币圈进行了持续几年的大、小区块大战，中国矿工携交易所，和比特币原教旨主义者开始了路线生死之争，最终大区块大败，分裂出BCH、BSV，中国矿工还被贴了“矿霸”标签。\n\n小区块帮派的带头人是Adam Back和Greg Maxwell， 后来组建了Blockstream，从事比特币侧链Liquid Network开发。 所以，圈内一直有个阴谋论，Blockstream帮为了自己的侧链，不惜分裂比特币网络，力主小区块，反对比特币扩容，为Liquid Network带货。\n\n阴谋论归阴谋论，这么多年下来，对比大区块分叉链的发展，显然，小区块主义者是有先见之明的。\n\n2023年，在中国散户和交易所带动下，以铭文为载体，发起新一波“大区块主义”运动。\n\n铭文问题的核心还是比特币扩容，本质还是大、小区块之争。\n\n铭文当然是市场需求驱动的，但比特币毕竟是小杯子，铭文是杯子里玩龙卷风，硬挤必然导致正常交易被挤压。\n\n我也曾经是大区块主义者，相信技术就应该满足最广大民众的需求，但后面完全和解了。\n\n比特币是宗教和价值存储，需要极端保守和百年不变；\n\n以太坊是进步主义，需要更新和快速迭代；\n\n我们没必要做二选一，各有各爱，喜欢热闹和创新，可以到以太坊玩或者侧链去玩，让比特币做安静的价值存储不好？\n\n大、小区块涉及比特币定位和扩容，不仅是技术路线之争，本质上还是关于“比特币是什么”的认知之争。\n\n如果比特币采取加速科技主义的大区块路线，满足所有的用户的所有需求，那必须无上限扩容，不仅仅是铭文这类资产；\n\n13-15年，有很多项目尝试直接在比特币上实现智能合约功能。这样比特币的定位扩展成通用的智能合约平台和资产平台。实际情况是，即使以太坊这么灵活的架构，实现这样的扩容都非常难，如果不放弃比特币其它核心诉求，技术上是无法实现的。\n\n大区块主义打补丁式的扩容，走一步算一步，是冒进和投机主义。头疼医头，脚痛医脚，根本无法固化比特币的底层；作为资产平台，比特币可以不比以太坊灵活，同样，作为价值资产，你不能比以太坊更冒进。\n\n所以，不是比特币没有星辰大海的梦想，而是过去十年的尝试，在技术和叙事上，找到自己的最大公约数，也顺便“解决”了扩容问题。\n\n比特币是怎么解决扩容问题的？\n\n比特币的办法是调整叙事，变成“数字黄金”和非主权货币，在这个叙事下，扩容反而成了伪命题，把扩容难题丢给以太坊去解决吧。\n\n在数字黄金的叙事下，tps，扩容本身就成了“伪命题”。实体黄金每年的物理周转占库存1%的比例都不到，比特币作为价值存储，主链上不需要高频交易，所以tps，扩容根本不是问题。\n\n其实以太坊解决扩容问题，也是异曲同工，把主网变成结算网络（贵、慢、稳），让L2真正去解决扩容和tps难题。\n\n但问题来了，比特币没有高的tps和链上交易，哪里来的高额手续费？没有高额手续费，如果比特币2140年挖完，网络安全如何确保？这个核心问题，是大区块主义者力推无上限扩容的最根本逻辑点。\n\n说实话，这确实是比特币的命门，这个问题现在无解；但毕竟是2140年才需要去面对的。 如果比特币到100万亿美金，我相信会倒逼大家形成新的代币模型和共识，解决“手续费”问题。\n\n小区块主义者，虽然无法回答“区块奖励结束，低容量比特币的低手续费无法维持网络安全”的核心问题，但大区块主义的扩容主张，显然是对比特币的核心价值更是直接的毁灭性的打击；无限扩容意味着不断变动和引入技术风险，扩到最后，大区块主义者依然无法解决现有框架的扩容问题，反而导致臃肿、低效、节点集中、极高技术风险，这都是对比特币作为数字黄金，坚不可摧安全性和永久价值储存核心定位的致命打击。\n\n小区块和大区块，两权相害，取其轻；我认为小区块主义，在逻辑上更自洽，把“手续费”问题留给百年后的持币人；而大区块主义，打补丁式的扩容，这种短视带来的负面影响是即时的。\n\n作为持币人，比特币生态热闹当然是好的，但比特币不可能满足所有人的所有需求；技术和欲望的张力如何平衡，可能是持币人、炒币者、矿工、交易所都需要考虑的问题。\n\n没有一个稳固的、不变的技术底层，比特币无法成为终极的价值存储，高手续费也是短暂的幻觉。\n\n铭文问题，只是大区块、小区块路线之争的小插曲，或许有技术替代方案能在两个派系之间找到最大公约数；\n\n能谈数还是坐下来谈数，再分叉了就很傻叉了。"

            "full_text": "这几天每天16个小时📞，诸多感悟，简单概括一下。\n\n1.这一轮brc行情和17年ico很像，本质是新的资产发行方式出现了。而且规避了对公众募资的风险，所以在国内大肆铺开。而且你会发现很多ico时代的老人这一波都参与了，因为他们熟悉这种牛市啊，引入社区，营造fomo情绪，操纵价格。\n\n2.目前铭文赛道已经进入到第三阶段：\n第一阶段是ordi出现，铭文从无到有，能在ordi上赚钱的是运气成分偏多，没有太多的主观努力（也可能是我不知道ordi有庄，如果谁知道内幕欢迎私聊哈哈）。\n第二阶段是sats等试验性项目出现，这些项目的初心是公平发射，但是其实背后都被野庄接管了。你们去看看mint的速率曲线就知道了。\n第三阶段就是现在，已经到了明庄阶段。最近两周出现的新铭文项目，背后的庄都不是秘密。这种时候你参与，双方的力量是完全不对等，所以如果你不知道背后是谁在主导，且价格已经非常夸张，我建议要开始谨慎，毕竟你想割庄难度很大，庄想割你轻轻松松。\n\n3. 第三阶段还有没有机会？答案是有的，但是我觉得倍数已经无法和阶段一二相比，阶段一二是有1000x甚至10000x机会的，但是阶段三，由于有明庄，散户已经很难获得廉价的筹码，更别谈大量廉价的筹码了。而且像我上一条说的，散户有被收割的可能性。但是三阶段因为资本力量的接入，项目会在叙事和产品形态上有不错的升级，至少不会像简单发个铭文这么原始。最近的很多铭文项目，背后都是有产品交付的，所以有了价值支撑，我觉得这也是好事。\n\n4.上一波DeFi牛市（2020-2021）的受益者目前踏空比例j较高。因为DeFi是一个专业性相对比较强，且在意场景落地价值的叙事，所以能在上一轮牛市有收获的人多多少少都有了固化的思维和认知。这里不得不佩服李笑来说过的话：韭菜的共识也是共识（这里我并没有在讽刺，是真的佩服）。不要老想讲一个精英才能听懂的叙事，也不要老想创造价值，有时候能赚钱就是最大价值，有时候故事简单粗暴更容易让社区壮大。\n\n5.我很期待这波踏空的DeFi精英接下来的操作。因为我觉得DeFi的从业者是非常优秀的，他们既懂技术，又懂金融，还在上一轮牛市有了丰富的项目运作经验和资源。他们已经关注到了铭文这一波的热度，我相信依照他们的聪明，他们肯定很快会进场，并带来不错的创新。其实最近一周已经有很多项目出现了，都是DeFi场景和铭文的结合，但是目前还是以中国项目为主，西方的DeFi圈子还慢半拍。如果你有不错的想法或已经在开发，可以私聊我或者@ResearchNothing\n\n6.后面铭文还有没有机会？除了铭文，btc生态还有没有其他机会？答案一定是有！因为这样一个全新的资产发行赛道，垂直赛道的龙头都空着，而且矿工集团有动力持续推动。矿工是这一波铭文的最大受益者，最近比特币的手续费都快赶上出块奖励了，对他们来说就是2倍挖矿速度。尝过山珍海味谁还愿意回去吃咸菜呢？所以我觉得他们会持续做局，来推动比特币生态的繁荣。\n\n7.最后，理性的提示一下：我之前thread里面提到了一个概念，铭文资产上cex是一个增加流动性+增加流通率的过程，这个过程会使得支撑fdv所需要的真实资金变多。这会对铭文的价格上涨形成阻力，这个平衡点我觉得已经到来。最近几日龙头如ordi和sats的表现就比较明显，刚上所时的势头已经没有了。一旦这个过程持续更久，且cex不再给剩余铭文提供流动性（也就是listing），那么铭文的的低流动性特质就会暴露，可能会有强烈的负螺旋。"

            "full_text": "在恶补铭文+深入探访铭文圈2周后，今儿来做个分享。\n\n🧐先说我得出了啥结论：\n1.牛市里一定要拿一部分资金（大概总仓位的3-10%，依据个人喜好），参与低流动性+低流通率的资产，因为容易获得mega回报（100x-10000x）。\n2.心态要开放，不要拒绝任何新东西。这个行业的新东西可能没有价值，但是不耽误它能赚钱！。\n3.不要懒！不要懒！不要懒！多了解新东西可能没有用，但是一定不会有害。\n\n🧐然后我来说说我怎么看待btc铭文：\n1.类NFT交易方式+比特币链性能（低tps，高手续费）+粗糙的基础设施（钱包+dex），这三点导致btc铭文的真实流动性比以太坊上的NFT还要低。\n2.低流动性导致的低流通率。在上中心化大所之前，btc铭文的真实流通率（我指出现在order book上）是极低的，我认为普遍在10%以内，甚至某些庄家盘在1%以内，所以只需要极少的资金流入就可以撑起一个高倍的fdv。这一幕是不是和sam系似曾相识？上一轮很多sol上面的项目都是超高fdv，但是超低流通率，然后在ftx无限拉盘。\n3.中心化大所的流动性注入可以瞬间帮助低流动性低流通率资产的价格完成量级的提升（10x）。最近币安上线ordi和sats，都基本有这个级别的涨幅。这种涨幅会远超一个本就具有不错流动性和流通率的资产的表现（比如token/meme）。\n4.极低的初始定价+极低流动性，非常容易营造超高倍纸面涨幅，进而产生巨大的fomo情绪，从而带来溢价。在币圈有一句话，没有什么问题是一根大阳线解决不了，如果有，那就两根。而铭文是十根大阳线，还根根100%。现在不管是在微信还是在x，我的真实感觉就是，只要你玩了铭文，你就血赚。有这种情绪价值在，其他的叙事和赛道都被吸血，全市场都在追逐的东西能没有溢价？\n5.这种极为粗暴的商业模式（击鼓传花），且非常适合sop流程化推广的参与方式，使得目前铭文圈90%的项目方都来自中国 深圳，西方参与度非常低，主流资本定义为meme逻辑。\n\n🧐我再来说说对铭文后面发展的一点小看法。\n1.没有一个资产可以永久获得市场的注意力。所以在享受注意力带来的巨大短期溢价后，一旦失去注意力，溢价也会变成负溢价（简单的说，出来混都是要还的）。\n2.铭文上中心化所是一个增加流动性+增加流通率的过程，这个过程会使得铭文的杠杆率降低，也就是支撑fdv所需要的真实资金会要变多。这个平衡点我觉得很快会到来，而一旦这个平衡点到来，下面铭文的定价逻辑就变了，就不是流动性定价格，而变成价值定价（这也是目前很多主流项目，比如layer1/layer2/defi项目的定价逻辑）。\n3.短期看，铭文还处在很早期的阶段，其真实价值并没有那么大。目前铭文的价格由2%的真实价值+98%的情绪价值组成。\n4.中期看，资本在铭文赛道的投入意愿并不强。这是好也是不好，好是好在散户的机会多。不好是在，没有资本的长期主义式投入和支持，铭文赛道很难跑出健康的生态。没有生态，价值有限。这也是目前西方资本对铭文的集体看法，偏meme逻辑。\n5.还是要分清楚比特币生态和比特币铭文的差别，很多人喜欢把两者合起来说事，但是我可以明确说，两者不是一回事儿。\n6.长期看，铭文会成为一个全新的资产类型永存，也会有更多的场景出现，但是这个赛道里资产的表现形式会和NFT很像，1%的资产捕获100%的价值，剩下99%的资产都归零。\n7.当然，作为一个偏底层的技术赛道，还是有很多大牛开发者在持续建设，所以我会持续保持对铭文的关注，等待看到它基本面升华的那一刻。\n\n最后，最近有很多创业团队找到我诉苦，说自从铭文火了，他们的项目增长都停滞了，甚至还失血，因为用户都去打铭文了，对非铭文类资产根本提不起兴趣。\n我想说，市场经历短期的疯狂后还是会回归价值。我还是依旧很看好mass adoption是这一轮牛市主旋律，如果你有game(fi)/social(fi)/e-commerce/lifestyle类型的项目demo，欢迎随时联系我或者是@ResearchNothing。"

            "full_text": "[帮粉丝转发]\n@okxchinese  @Cryptosis9_OKX  @okx \n希望okx官方帮忙查询一下.\n前天也就是2023.12.28日，tonka项目方@tonkafinance 于他的官网 https://t.co/K3cMej249o 开启了三轮预售（预售是订阅形式，每轮超出的金额会进行退款）\n\n三轮预售的合约分别如下\n\n第一轮：https://t.co/RKIopbbrna\n第二轮：https://t.co/QEV8O0X2qC\n第三轮：https://t.co/sFV7xVbaGB\n\n但是在第三轮预售时，出现了另一个合约 https://t.co/SAi1cnvRHl，下文简称疑似合约。可以看到，该疑似合约共募集了348eth\n\n对第一轮，第二轮预售合约，以及疑似合约的部署者地址进行分析，我们可以清楚的看到，这三个部署者分别于18876687，18876692，18876697三个区块高度从okx 24的交易所地址获取了0.25eth的初始资金，如图一\n\n在收到初始资金的10分钟之后，疑似合约的部署地址率先于12.27日晚上9.37分部署了一个和第一轮合约，第二轮合约，疑似合约相同的合约0xF5B5679501641D0293f2652bf51192aB11d64197（下文简称初始合约）\n\n15分钟后的9.52分，项目方部署了第一轮预售合约0xA4c998C1CcDc35d046fEB0B6D2D98c4765360dC9，后续设置合约开启时间戳为12.28日早上10点\n\n又过了4分钟的9.56分，项目方部署了第二轮预售合约0xf7AAF350B4aA5bF0AC00C3C47C03F5fad2205f77，后续设置合约开启时间戳为12.28日晚上6点\n\n2分钟之后，疑似合约的部署地址于9.58分部署了疑似合约0x37df6b93e35622a25ba95fc41afd2f4d06808a84，后续设置合约开启时间戳为12.29日凌晨2点\n\n四个合约均进行了开源，通过合约分析，我们可以得知四个合约代码是完全相同且之前未曾在链上出现过的合约，因此在项目方的第一轮第二轮预售结束后，许多用户就认定0x37df6b93e35622a25ba95fc41afd2f4d06808a84 的疑似合约是项目方第三轮预售准备使用的收款合约\n\n12.28日项目方在早上10点，晚上6点开启了第一轮，第二轮预售，前两轮预售均顺利进行，预售过程中出现很多用户使用16进制往合约内打钱，导致预售几乎是在2-3个区块内就结束了，由于网页卡顿的原因，手动用户基本抢不到预售份额，项目方承诺会进行防bot的措施\n\n12.29日凌晨2点，项目方开启了第三轮预售，部分用户采用16进制往合约打钱的方式向0x37df6b93e35622a25ba95fc41afd2f4d06808a84疑似合约内进行打款，但此时项目方采用了一个新的合约0xf74D46bf790a9Bf48531024448BA5d3AE4072866作为第三轮预售的收款合约，项目方地址0x623d31E9fB8D3bE33995CB716725f9D46d3006Ea于12.28日晚上11.10分从okx 25获取了0.4e的初始资金并部署了这个与第一轮第二轮预售合约不同的新的预售合约\n\n至此，tonka项目三轮预售结束，均顺利募足资金，疑似合约0x37df6b93e35622a25ba95fc41afd2f4d06808a84 也收到了348.17eth的资金，此时大部分使用16进制的用户认为0x37df6b93e35622a25ba95fc41afd2f4d06808a84 是项目方部署的旧合约，是一种防bot的举措，并在tg群内和项目方进行沟通退款事宜\n\n2023.12.29日，项目方发出通知，0x37df6b93e35622a25ba95fc41afd2f4d06808a84 是一个骗子合约，不承认是其项目团队所部署，此举在电报群内引起大量声讨，用户们几乎一致认为，0x37df6b93e35622a25ba95fc41afd2f4d06808a84 明显就是项目方团队所部署的合约，单纯的不愿意进行退款，项目方在电报群内声明，如能证明0x37df6b93e35622a25ba95fc41afd2f4d06808a84 是其团队所部署，才会给出后续的解决方案。\n\n梳理整个事件过程，可疑的点有以下两点\n1.第一轮，第二轮预售合约，以及疑似合约的部署者地址分别于18876687，18876692，18876697三个区块高度从okx 24的交易所地址获取了0.25eth的初始资金，中间仅仅间隔5个区块，如下图2\n\n2.疑似合约0x37df6b93e35622a25ba95fc41afd2f4d06808a84 部署者部署了最早的初始合约0xF5B5679501641D0293f2652bf51192aB11d64197，该合约与第一轮，第二轮预售合约完全相同，试问如果不是项目方，怎么会能第一个知道项目方的首款合约并率先部署于链上呢。\n\n为尽可能的挽回用户损失，证明tonka项目方清白，希望okx能够帮忙查证一下 \n0x55341c200984bcd2a3e3a4ea85F24d4b19ad9C73\n0xB25558d4390d331E18a8f5F03C165935EC86Cc67\n0x5792531700Fc44e2dAB792cE2D04Fa9A7E857B79  这三个地址初始收到的0.25e是否来源用同一个okx账户，如来源于同一账户，即可得知0x37df6b93e35622a25ba95fc41afd2f4d06808a84这个收了348e的疑似合约也属于tonka项目方"

            "full_text": "【什么是 Dmint？BTC 资产协议的 POW 尝试】\n\n本条将介绍 #Atomicals 的 #Dmint 更新，并向你介绍如何将 POW 用于 BTC 资产发行的新玩法。  \n\n如果能帮到你，请转发🔁点赞❤️，感谢你的支持。\n\n----------------------------------\n\nAtomicals 协议更新了的 NFT 铸造方法 Dmint，并在设计中大量引入了类比特币 POW 挖矿的 Bitwork。\n\n这非常地符合比特币文化，也戳中了社区的兴奋点，因为下载安装环境的人太多，甚至一度将 Atomicals 的 github 代码库热度送上了总榜第十一。\n\n那么，什么是 Dmint ？为什么你应该关注 Dmint？\n\nAtomicals 除了能像 #BRC20 一样发行 Token 外，也能用于制作所有数据存储在 BTC 上的 NFT，当然其方式与 #Ordinals 也不同。\n\nAtomicals 的 NFT 铸造方法被称为 Dmint，这是一种更公平、更去中心化的 NFT 发射方式。\n\nNFT 部署者需要将系列的每一张 NFT 图片都编号（如0000到9999），Atomicals 协议会计算每一张图片文件的 hash 值，并为每一张图生成单独的 json 文件。\n\n随后协议会将上述图片 hash 数值通过默克尔树的方式计算出一个证明，这个证明可以用于验证系列中任意一张 NFT。\n\nNFT 系列的部署者将这个证明，与 NFT 的名称、描述、Logo、挖矿难度等数据一起写入交易，发送到比特币网络中，完成系列的注册。\n\n因此部署者注册过程中只需要发送 NFT 图片的 proof 证明，而不是每一张 NFT 图片本身，就算一次性部署 1000 万张的系列也花不了多少 sats。\n\n随后 NFT 项目方公开每一张 NFT 的图片和 json 文件，用户选择后，自行发送比特币交易，将图片数据与 json 刻入 BTC 区块中，完成单张 NFT 的铸造（认领）。\n\n这些 NFT 图片的 hash 值可以与注册交易中的默克尔树证明互相验证。\n\n这就完成了 NFT 成系列的发行与铸造。\n\n----------------------------------\n\n当然，重头戏还在与 NFT 的公平发射部分，Dmint 在这里引入的创新主要有两点：\n\n🔷 Bitwork 挖矿后才可以 mint，且能在一个系列中自定义多个难度；\n\n🔷 接受特定的 UTXO 来发送铸造交易，这可以用于收取 #ARC20 代币，也可以按要求支付给项目方\n\n首先是 Bitwork 挖矿，这是 Atomicals 协议独有的公平发射方式，部署者可以为铸造设定一个特定长度的前缀，铸造者必须使用电脑通过穷举的方式，碰撞出匹配特定前缀的 hash 值后，才能进行铸造。\n\n首先，合理设置的 Bitwork 有效地拉长了 mint 的窗口时间，给了一般玩家更多的机会。Dmint NFT 的铸造，没法批量操作，更不能仅通过拉高 gas 获得大量筹码，一个 CPU 一次机会，相对地公平分发。\n\n更进一步，在同一个 NFT 系列中，可以对不同的 NFT 设定不同的 Bitwork 难度（精确到每一个），比如：\n\n⚪️ 白板\n将系列后 8000 个 NFT 难度设定为 4位\n(计算 1 分钟)\n\n🟢 绿装\n1000-1999 序号的 NFT 难度设定为 5 位\n(计算 16 分钟)\n\n🟣 紫装\n100-999 序号的 NFT 难度设定为 6 位\n(计算 256 分钟，即4个小时)\n\n🟠 传奇\n0-99 序号的 NFT 难度设定为 7 位\n(计算 3 天)\n\n如何你认同比特币 pow 的价值，那么通过 Bitwork 计算的方式也提炼了价值，这不可作伪地记录了 NFT 的稀有度。\n\n显而易见，这种可变难度的设计，最容易想到的就是域名的发行：短域名数量少价值高，对应 Bitwork 难度高，大矿主就可以尝试挖矿赚取大量收益；长域名数量多价值相对更低，对应 Bitwork 难度低，任何普通人也能花几分钟为自己铸造一个。\n\n在没有中心、公共的网络中，属于全人类的域名如何公平的分配？\n\nBitwork 这种存粹的计算是最能获得共识的。\n\n这种设计似乎也呼应了 13年前中本聪的构想，以下是他的原话：“应该给矿工一些报酬，你可以考虑使用一定的工作量来生成一个域名。”\n\nNFT MINT 的挖矿仅仅只是 Atomicals 的开始，创世团队也在考虑通过修改索引，将可变难度的 bitwork 引入 arc20 代币的发行，这实在令人兴奋。\n\nBitwork 本身在 BTC 的应用层计算，且需要协议传入各种环境参数，因此将挖矿和发送交易完全分开并不可行。\n\n目前内卷的极限也就是至于 GPU 显卡竞赛了，大型矿池乃至 asic 都不会出现。因此短期里，普通家用电脑去竞争 Bitwork 仍然有大量机会，当然，我预计出售算力的代打服务也会很快上线。\n\n----------------------------------\n\n第二个有趣的创新是，不仅仅是 BTC，Atomicals 协议还允许了接受特定的 UTXO 来发送 NFT 铸造交易，这意味着可以在铸造 NFT 的同时收取某种 #ARC20 的 Token。\n\n这就是 Atomicals 协议的染色币设计的优势，1 arc20 = 1 sat 的原生 UTXO 赋予了其更好的可编程性。\n\n无需任何的额外的开发，Atomicals 的 NFT 与 #ARC20 之间天然就可以产生“套娃”关系，使用 arc20 去打新 NFT（而 arc20 本身也可以设置 bitwork 挖矿），甚至可以使用旧系列 NFT 去 mint 新系列的 NFT，这其实提供了巨大的可能性。\n\n----------------------------------\n\n越来越多的铭文协议开始引入类 bitwork 的挖矿 mint 功能。\n\n字符串跳动起来，直观地给人带来的质感是完全不同的。\n\nBTC 文化的复兴运动正在压倒加密世界的一切共识。\n\n人们已经在铭文狂潮中对“公平分发”产生了强大的第一次共识，在探寻“更公平的分发”，与在 meme 中寻找价值的过程中，必然会对 POW 本身进行第二次共识。\n\n这将给 Atomicals 协议，以及任何愿意尝试的协议带来新一轮的大发展，Dmint 只是一个楔子。\n\n#Atomicals #BTC #POW #NFT #ARC20 #铭文"

            "full_text": "最近市场太好忙着赚钱好久没有静下心研究东西了😂最近因为价格的原因对于以太坊不满的声音很多，但相信我请认真读完这篇文章，也许你会释怀。\n今天Vitalik关于质押的文章给LSD赛道又主力了一把，不过一如既往写的很学术派晦涩，简单解读一下不一定准确，全文依然在探讨老生常谈的话题，如何在保证安全和去中心化的前提下，尽可能降低质押门槛（资金+技术）让更多的solo staker产生，甚至有没有可能人人都可以去运营一个节点，不要再把自己作为验证者的权力交给质押池，核心宗旨就是去质押持化，虽然剑指Lido，但市场不管这么多反正Vitalik讲了质押的文章那Lido就得给我涨。\n这里面提到了很重要的一点是当存在大量节点，每个时隙如何处理大量签名的负载问题，在POW里出块的时间由挖矿难度决定，而在POS里速度是固定的，以太坊是12 秒出块，即一个时隙，原因是对去中心化和最终确定时间之间的平衡，更短的时间意味着要求节点性能更强大，从而导致节点门槛增高降低了去中心化，而更长的时间则导致网络性能降低，经过大量基准测算认为12秒是比较好平衡两者的数字。\n而并不意味着出了块后就完全安全了，还要达到最终确定性，即在不销毁所有质押 ETH 至少 1/3 的情况下，无法更改或撤消最终确定的区块。\n在每个时隙中会随机选择一个验证者作为区块提议者。该验证者负责创建一个新块并将其发送到网络上的其他节点。\n除12秒的时隙外还有个概念叫epoch纪元，32个时隙为一个纪元即6.4分钟，每个纪元开始时整个验证者集会被分为 32 个委员会，所以每个时隙有一个委员会投票用于确定所提议区块的有效性，这也就是为什么质押进出排队是以epoch为单位的。\n在接下来的 32 个时隙中，​​每个委员会将对其相应时隙中提议的区块进行投票，经过两个纪元后，每个区块都被整个验证者集投票两次，这样该区块就真正达到了最终有效性，永久被写入链中，所以最终有效性大约在15分钟。\n所以以太坊一直在追求如何能够实现单时隙最终性（SSF），即出一个块就确定一个块的最终有效性，这样虽然对于网络的性能将会极大提高，但同样会极大的增加单个时隙的签名数量，以太坊有5亿用户的话，10%质押就意味着每个时隙要产生1亿个签名（最终有效性要进行2次签名），这就要求每个节点的性能要求非常强，但如此高的门槛又必然无法实现去中心化更多节点参与，操，可真难啊。\n现在每个时隙已经有28000个签名了，Vitalik认为当达到SSF后每个时隙签名还要再压缩到8192个签名（下文会讲为什么选择这个数字）才能有效缓解网络和节点负担，实现在人人都可以做验证者的前提下还可以增加网络安全性和性能。\n如何实现呢？Vitalik提了三种方案。\n一是all in 去中心化质押池，直接将最低质押金额提到4096个，验证者总数也限制为4096个，让大家都别自己运营节点了，这非常激进，不可取。\n二是搞双层质押，之前vitalik的文章中其实写过这个思路，有点轻节点和全节点的感觉，上层的轻层没有质押最低金额限制人人可以参与，下层的重层要求质押4096ETH的参与最终确定性，但也不够完美，毕竟分成了两层不够平等。\n三则是轮流参与，对于每个时隙选择4096个活跃的验证器进行签名，签署2次则为8192个，这个方式相对比较合理但难度在于会使得共识层协议更加复杂，但优点是保留了solo staker，甚至可以将质押门槛降低到1ETH。\n以上就是Vitalik这篇文章的解读，其实想想作为散户我们觉得以太坊不作为Vitalik不拉币价，但是站到Vitalik到角度每天躲在自己的小房间拿着草稿纸计算怎么样能够让以太坊更加去中心化和安全，让更多人参与进来打造成真正的世界计算机。"

            "full_text": "说说当下流动性宽松原因以及未来的流动性风险：\n1、刚才说当下市场流动性其实还可以的。从10月底财政部回补完账户余额之后就又开始加大了支出力度，近两个月财政部账户余额从8300亿美金讲道理6400亿美金，最近三个月1800亿美金的平均赤字水平。看开支大项，拜登经济学的三大法案刺激贡献主要财政支出增量。\n\n另一方面，上周美联储隔夜逆回购用量已经降到了6800亿美金。今年以来美联储每个月950亿美金的被动缩表，8月份财政部疯狂发债，这里面大部分都是短债而且这些短债基本上都被从隔夜逆回购撤出的资金给承接走了。这也导致了23年年内隔夜逆回购用量减少了1.9万亿美金。这是一个极大的体量\n\n一方面隔夜逆回购用量的减少对冲了财政部发债对市场流动性的虹吸，另一方面加大财政支持力度其实就是财政端给市场输血。导致的结果就是美联储存款机构超额准备金年内增加了6000亿美金，超额准备金增加商业银行可以用于信贷的额度增加，那么市场的流动性就会宽松。这也是为什么今年高利率，联储持续缩表的情况、市场流动性反倒愈发宽松。\n\n2、但是未来流动性的风险也就出来了。刚才说隔夜逆回购用量已经降到6800亿美金，按照之前的消耗速度基本上再有两个月隔夜逆回购用量再被耗5000亿美金基本空间就被压制光了。之后再发短债融资，恐怕会导致逆回购市场利率飙升，甚至可能出现短期流动性危机。\n\n而等到消耗这块资金的时候，美联储还按照当前的量化紧缩速度继续，届时还要继续关注的财政部账户余额消耗情况本身就需要继续发债如果账户余额消耗过大需要再次回补，那么权益市场的流动性压力就会来袭，即使个股基本面情况较好，仍然不排除估值压缩的压力。届时市场面临流动性冲击\n\n3、这也能部分解释为什么上周议息会议美联储的超预期转向。\n鲍威尔在上周记者会上最后一个问题上，在提及量化紧缩的时候，也闪烁其词地说了一下，等逆回购资金空间耗光，下一个很有可能被消耗的就是银行的准备金余额，也就是银行放在美联储的存款。上面说了，准备金余额是决定市场流动性宽松与否的关键，如果准备金余额开始被快速消耗那么市场流动性的压力会剧增。\n\n从这个角度来说、上周美联储的超预期转向其实暗含了货币政策和财政政策在时间点上的配合。等到明年3月份，隔夜逆回购用量消耗殆尽，开始消耗准备金的时候。同时财政部就不得不开始大幅依赖长债发行来融资，美联储前期铺垫，3月身体力行地去降息（至少通过主动迎合市场降息预期），把长期利率预期压降下来。\n\n这对于未来几个月风险市场的时点就显得相当微妙了：\n1）财政部的提款机隔夜逆回购用量在2月份会消耗殆尽，那么短期流动性压力会在2、3月份显现出来。这就是一个杀估值的因素。当然近俩月应该还不用担心。\n2）目前市场预计明年第一次降息发生在3月份——这个是抬估值因素；但是这也是美联储内部分歧最大的地方，会不会在三月份降估计还要讨论很久，但是届时流动性冲击也会给美联储施压压力。如果会降，则是一个抬估值的因素。\n3）而这期间只要财政部支出力度得以继续，经济基本面应该不会出大问题。\n\n这一轮美国的经济繁荣，本质上是把居民和企业的负债都过继给了联邦政府，现在的联邦政府负债累累，当市场“闲钱”耗尽之际，真正需要用长期资金为美国财政融资的时候，美元的借款利率不得已，就到了需要回头的时候。"

            "full_text": "上周因为议息会议的超预期转向，市场情绪被大幅提振起来。\n1、鲍威尔不再继续higher and longer的叙事，转而谈论”higher and longer ”的风险，还谈论到降息之意。经济预测显示24年降息三次，24见底利率预期中位值4.6%，通胀下行失业率温和上升（当然这些都是预期，21年联储已经错过一次游戏要注意）。\n\n整体来说对于市场来说是难得的利好，可以说本轮比赛紧缩周期里加息基本上已经结束，就看未来什么时间降息了。而正是这个降息时间点，应该是美联储内部分歧最大的地方。上周五三位地方联储主席的讲话就清晰地表明了这一点：纽约联储主席认为市场过于乐观反应过度、亚特兰大联储主席认为三季度降息，芝加哥联储主席则不排除3月降息的可能性。\n\n可以预见未来一段时间对美联储的降息预期很大可能上影响短期市场情绪和走势。好的方面24年降息是确定的，不确定的是时间。\n\n2、经济层面就像上周五公布的制造业和服务业pmi一样，制造业pmi继续在荣枯线以下萎靡，服务业则是从9月以内温和反弹。基本上来说，经济基本面依然还在，还是之前说的远没到需要担心衰退的地步。\n\n3、但上周末以内中东地缘冲突略有加剧，很多人应该也注意到了全球前五大船运公司基本上都停运了苏伊士运河到红海的航线转走好望角，带来的货运成本的加剧不得不防，甚至短期内引发市场波动。\n\n4、从整体近期的流动性和金融环境上来看、市场压力并不是很大。财政部也加大了支出力度，致使存款机构超额准备金还在温和攀升，同时金融压力指数继续在年内低点。\n\ncnn的恐惧贪婪指数上周中快要接近进入80以上贪婪区间，只是美联储三位理事分歧明显的讲话一下子把贪婪指数又给降到66。这种情况下其实还是有利于市场的。\n\n总体来说：\n上周道指已经新高，标普接近新高，纳斯达克还差9%、罗素2000还差20%。这也能说明市场对美联储的大幅度转向计价比较充分。预期兑现后，再加上联储内部关于降息时点的分歧估计会让市场出现一定程度的震荡调整。当然这样也可以算是用时间来化解短期内已经超买的美股技术指标。\n\n同时元旦和圣诞双节以及年终机构止盈需求对市场短期是不利的，也对应了上面说的有可能迎来的震荡调整。但个人觉得调整幅度可能并不会很大，震荡调整完可以期待标普未来什么时间也能到ATH。"

            "full_text": "降息之门已打开！早上起来看了凌晨联储利率决议和记者会，最大的感受就是鸽派大转向：\n1、本次声明依然认为通胀“高企”跟五月份之后几次类似，但本次对通胀的表述新增了放缓的评价，称“过去一年通胀已放缓，但仍然高企”。\n相比上次的经济活动强劲扩张，这次则是明确说经济强劲步伐已放缓，\n重申就业已放缓、虽然仍强劲头，失业率保持在低位。\n其实只要联储认为通胀已放缓，这对市场就是好消息。\n\n2、而在更受关注的点阵图上：\n本次提供利率预测的19名FOMC票委中，共有11人、占比近53%的联储官员预计，明年至少降息三次，共五人、占比26%的官员预计至少降息四次。\n而9月预计明年至少三次降息的官员只有五人，只有本月如此预测人数的一半。\n\n2024年底的联邦基金利率中位值为4.6%，较9月预计的5.1%下调50个基点。以最新的中位值预测水平估算，到明年底利率均值达到4.65%时，未来一年内会降息75个基点，以每次降息25个基点计算，相当于明年共降息三次。\n\n3、在同受关注的经济预测上：\n美联储官员上调了今年的GDP增长预期，小幅下调明年的经济增速预期，今明后三年失业率预期不变，下调今明后三年的PCE与核心PCE通胀预期，其中今年的预期均下调50个基点，仍预计2026年通胀回落到联储目标2%。\n\n特别是对通胀预期，9月预期23年通胀为3.3%今天下调到2.8%、9月认为24年底为2.5%今天下调到2.4%。\n9月预期23年核心通胀3.7%今天下调到3.2%、9月预期24年核心通胀2.6%今天下调到2.4%。均大幅回落\n\n4、这次议息会议让我最意外的是鲍师傅的讲话，之前认为他的讲话可能跟之前差不多，鹰鸽都有。但是看了凌晨鲍师傅的记者会文字实录，我最大的感受就是鲍师佛的态度其实有个非常大的转变，虽然🈶不少还是老生常谈，但是明确提到“降息进入视野，意识到长期保持高利率的风险，不会等到通胀降到2%再降息”这些话应该是让市场非常惊喜的。\n\n之前有聊到10月以来这一波行情，金融压力大幅度减轻至年内低点，财政部暂缓发债节奏并且重新支出提升了市场的流动性，更重要还有强烈的降息预期。这一次议息会议美联储相当于是支持了这种降息预期。虽然市场的降息时点和幅度预期相比美联储需要略作调整。\n\n整体来说，最大的感受就是鲍师佛和美联储官员们毫不犹豫地展示出来鸽派的态度，无论是利率决议声明还是点阵图经济预测、抑或是鲍威尔地发言，都表明了这一点。上一次说美联储到了“只说不做”的阶段，兑现最后一次加息是遥不可及的。现在来看美联储可能连“只说不做”都要抛弃，更坚决的转了向。"

            "full_text": "🙏 R.I.P 查理·芒格 1924.1.1-2023.11.28 🙏\n我不期许向芒格一样长寿和富有，愿能如他一样智慧和笃定。\n\n近期，99 岁的芒格罕见地现身热门商业播客节目 Acquired 的录制，谈论了他的投资观点、经验和教训。这很可能是他生前最后一次接受采访。\n\n在节目中，芒格谈到了他对 Costco、可口可乐、苹果、比亚迪、特斯拉、通用等众多知名企业的投资历程和独到见解，对中国、日本经济和投资的洞见，以及他对于未来的看法。值得一提的是，Acquired是芒格有生以来第一次做客一档播客节目。\n\n以下是华尔街见闻整理的芒格的核心观点：\n\n1. 散户只是对价格进行追涨杀跌而已。如果我是管理者，我会对短线获利征税，把这些投机者赶出市场。\n\n2. 在VC投资中能一次又一次地成功几乎是不可能的。所有的投资项目都很热门，投资人必须很快做决定。这就意味大多数人都只是在赌博。\n\n3. 中国经济未来20年的前景比其他任何大型经济体都要好。中国的头部企业更强大、更优秀，而且它们的估值要便宜得多。因此，我自然愿意在芒格投资组合中纳入一定中国风险资产。\n\n4. 当你持有某支股票5年后，你可能会慢慢融入其中，或者对它地理解会更深刻。但是，当你意识到你有优势的时候，你就应该下重注。你一定要在最好的投资上下重注！\n\n5. 如果我们（伯克希尔）自始至终使用更多一点的杠杆，我们现在的杠杆就会是原来的三倍，且风险也不会那么大，我们不希望杠杆会破坏我们的避险位置。\n\n6. 这（日本）是一个显而易见的投资机会。日本的利率10年来每年才0.5%。而这些公司确实是根深蒂固的老牌企业，他们拥有所有这些廉价的铜矿和橡胶基地，所以你可以提前10年借到所有的钱，去购买股票，并且支付5%的股息。 \n\n7. 会有人发现一些（投资）机会，但这变得越来越难了。我认为购买像（喜诗糖果、爱马仕）这样的公司的机会非常低，因此自己根本不会去寻找。我只相信并寻找那些我认为有可能找到的投资机会。\n\n8. 我喜欢像苹果一样真正拥有品牌的公司。伟大的品牌，要以适当的价格买入，诀窍就是抓住真正便宜的罕见机会下注。\n\n9. 如果一些公司的股票真的很便宜，尽管它是一家糟糕的公司，我都会考虑持有一段时间。\n\n10. 王传福是一个狂热的人，痴迷于亲手制造产品，所以他更靠近一线。换句话说，王传福比马斯克更擅长制造。\n\n11. 沃尔玛太执着于已有的想法，这是每个人的困扰。他们就是无法接受新事物，因为空间已经被旧的想法占据了。\n\n12. 我不会随便给任何年轻人建议，会慎重地考虑时机和对象，并不想成为精神导师。世界充满着欺骗和疯狂，年轻人越来越难了。\n以下为华尔街见闻编译的本次播客全内容：\n\n欢迎来到Acquired，一个专注于伟大科技公司及其背后的故事的播客。我是本·吉尔伯特。我是大卫·罗森塔尔。\n\n主持人：这对大卫和我来说是非常独特的一集，节目的好朋友安德鲁·马克思安排我们与查理·芒格以及其他几个人共进了晚餐，就在查理洛杉矶的家里。你们可以听到安德鲁几次在后台问查理问题。我们很确定，这是查理目前做过的唯一一个播客。\n\n查理与他的合伙人沃伦·巴菲特，是有史以来最多产的投资者之一。查理今年已经99岁高龄了，他将在明年1月1日满100岁。当然，我们的谈话很有趣，因为他是查理·芒格，但同样也因为，经历了过去99年人类历史的人的观点很有趣。\n\n当然，我们与查理谈论了Costco，他在过去50年中投资零售商的历史。我们还听到了他对其他一些问题的看法，比如建立良好伙伴关系所需的条件、全球证券市场的问题、投资与赌博的概念以及当今世界的投资机会。\n\n//

散户其实是在赌博\n\n主持人：查理，我上周末看了NFL（美国国家橄榄球联盟）比赛，现在似乎每个广告都与体育博彩有关。这对美国有好处吗？\n\n芒格：没有，当然没有。赛马以及赌场对美国有好处吗？当然没有。他们只是非常受欢迎。就是这样。\n\n主持人：沃伦已经赌上了。\n\n芒格：好吧，但沃伦从未豪赌过，他比较谨慎，记住，沃伦不是一般人，不会轻易拿一成的胜算去冒险。对。就是这么简单。\n\n主持人：下一个话题是股市散户交易，对许多美国人来说散户交易这类似于赌博。\n\n芒格：嗯，这就是为什么它是有组织的。散户对于公司或发生的任何事情都一无所知，他们只对价格进行追涨杀跌而已。如果我是管理者，我会对短线获利征税，把这些投机者赶出市场。这对每一个市场参与者都有好处。\n\n主持人：你对Renaissance Technologies等量化投资公司的算法有什么看法。\n\n芒格：Renaissance的第一个算法非常简单。这个算法会筛选历史数据，他们能决定什么？\n\n他们发现，如果（股票）连续两天收涨，接下来连续两天收跌的情况，比一天跌（涨）一天涨（跌）更加常见。\n\n他们意识到这是源于“奖励心理”，人类的内心深处是一个自然的趋势追随者，尤其在进行短期押注的情况下。量化公司利用计算机编程在上涨的第一天自动买进，然后在第二天收盘之前自动卖出套现。每天重复以上的动作，每一天，中央清算机构都会说，今天结算的话有850万美元，到了第二天就可能变成943万美元。\n\n结果是，最容易的交易是前端，指数基金必须进行的交易。没错。他们年复一年地为获得回报而提高杠杆，将杠杆变得越来越高。因此，他们的交易量越来越大，但是利润却越来越微薄，这给他们带来了巨大的风险，我自己是绝不会这么做的。这是他们轻松获得回报的唯一方法——巨大的杠杆。如果你已经很富有，这个杠杆会让你发疯的。\n\n// 02 投资Costco的原因\n\n主持人：我很好奇，你第一次是怎么想到投资Costco（前身Price Club）的？\n\n芒格：Rod Hills（芒格的合伙人之一）认识Sol Price（Price Club创始人），他了解Sol的生意。他对我说，你得去见见他。所以我开车直奔他的商店和Sol聊天。当然，Sol是一个非常聪明的人一直是一名律师，直到39岁，他开了一家做政府雇员生意的会员制折扣商店。\n\n主持人：这是在Fedco时代吗？\n\n芒格：他不再是Fedco，1975年来自德国的Hugo Mann收购Fedmart三分之二的股权。\n\n主持人：在Price Club与Costco合并之前，你有没有投资过它？\n\n芒格：是的，我买了他家的股票，但我是自己在股市上买的，我没有得到任何帮助。\n\n主持人：那么你最终是怎么认识人Jim Sinega（Costco的创始人）的？\n\n芒格：嗯，Sinega想要沃伦成为Costco的董事，他正寻找有卓越的金融声誉的投资者。\n\n主持人：作为一个独立的董事吗？\n\n芒格：是的，他（沃伦）不愿意去，说你让查理去做吧。我接受更短的飞机行程去独董会议，就是这样发生了。\n\n主持人：伯克希尔是否曾试图成为他们的股东或获得客户。\n\n芒格：我曾建议巴菲特在家乐福（Carrefour）离开印度时购买法国人的股份，但巴菲特拒绝了这个建议，因为他不喜欢零售业。\n\n主持人：只是他不喜欢零售还是有什么别的反对意见？\n\n芒格：他害怕零售业，他是对的，渐渐地，零售业中曾经强大的一切都消失了，合作伙伴离开了，零售有太多竞争对手，零售太难做了，他很担心。\n\n主持人：他在Diversified Retailing这家公司有过糟糕的经历对吗。\n\n芒格：不，我们从Diversified Retailing中赚了很多钱，我们并没有从零售行业中赚钱。\n\n整个故事非常简单，巴菲特和我买下了这家位于巴尔的摩的小型百货连锁店。这是个巨大的错误，因为竞争太激烈了！我们刚签完字后，就意识到我们犯了一个可怕的错误。所以我们决定扭转局面，承担看起来愚蠢的后果，而不是让它直接破产。在那些衰退的年代，我们就买买买，所有的钱都进入了这些股票，当然我们让它翻了两番。\n\n主持人：但这成就了Blue Chip吗（在20世纪60年代晚期到70年代早期，芒格、盖林和巴菲特逐渐收购了Blue Chip Stamps的控股股份。这家小公司是做帮助零售商家发行优惠券的生意。消费者收集这些优惠券，然后到门店用于消费。）\n\n芒格：我们应该做一些人们不知道的事情，是的，我们大约花了2000万美元买下了一家小型储蓄和贷款公司。当我们离开那家公司时，我们从2000万美元的‘小投资’中拿回了超过20亿美元的有价证券，这些证券成为投资内布拉斯加州的保险公司基础资本的一部分。这就是每个人都需要的、完美的开端。\n\n主持人：在我们聊到Costco的节目中，我们从大约10年前的一次伯克希尔会议上的笑话讲起，沃伦讲了一个关于你在一架被劫持的飞机上的笑话，劫机者可以满足你最后一个请求，你说你想发表演讲。\n\n芒格：这个事儿提醒了我。\n\n主持人：巴菲特的回答相当于“开枪打我”。我们希望你能给我们讲讲Costco的优点？\n\n芒格：你一生中很少会知道自己是对的，且会确定你做的事情会奏效。也许一生只有5、6次你们需要这样去做，而在早期可能会尝试两三次。很多人都破产了，以为一切很容易，而实际情况是非常困难和罕见的。\n\n主持人：是什么让你意识到Costco是一生中为数不多的时刻之一？\n\n芒格：他们的售价比美国任何地方都便宜，且他们是大型、高效的商店。Costco有充足且宽敞的停车位，所有停车位都有10英尺宽，以奖励积分的方式给予到店的人特殊福利； 让供应商等待（付款）直至Costco拿到消费者支付的货款。\n\n你有一个像Costco一样大的企业。一直贯彻执行“极致性价比”战略，且又有大型停车场，你想错过芒格案吗？\n\n公司一直贯彻执行“极致性价比”战略，通过低价优质的商品和聚焦3700个爆款SKU，带来单品更高的销售量和更高的周转效率，而高销量和高周转又反过来推动销售成本和运营费用的降低，形成正向循环；在会员经营端，会员费为主要利润来源，会员费收入和公司净利润规模基本相等，推进公司业绩实现持续高质量的成长。\n\n主持人：你有没有见过另一个利用低SKU（库存单位）和低成本来取得成功。\n\n芒格：加利福尼亚州的一家小杂货连锁店盖尔森兄弟（Gelson's），他们采用了与Costco类似的策略，但他们的经营方式不如Costco高效，因此无法实现类似的成功。\n\n// 03 在最好的投资上下重注\n\n主持人：当你回顾这些一生中为数不多的伟大公司之时，你应该大举押注，作为年轻的投资者，你会对David和我提出哪些建议？\n\n芒格：当你持有某支股票5年后，你可能会慢慢融入其中，或者对它地理解会更深刻。但是，当你意识到你有优势的时候，你就应该下重注。你知道你是对的，但是商学院可不会教这些。这可太不可思议了。你一定要在最好的投资上下重注！\n\n主持人：你如何培养这种信念水平？\n\n芒格：你在不断地工作探索，你认识到了它，通过大量的阅读和思考来理解。\n\n主持人：你和沃伦有着长达半个世纪的融洽合作关系，有什么变化吗？\n\n芒格：在我们共事的早期阶段，有很多无法判断的事情，没有任何一样事情可以轻易给出芒格案。\n\n主持人：那你们如何维持融洽的关系。\n\n芒格：我们都很相似，我们都想让家人安全，为投资者做好工作等等。我们有相似的态度。\n\n//04 伯克希尔应该使用更多杠杆\n\n主持人：在这几十年间，想法有变化吗？\n\n芒格：没有，沃伦依旧很在意安全这件事，更关心伯克希尔股东的安全，而不是其他事情，如果我们自始至终使用更多一点的杠杆，我们现在的杠杆就会是原来的三倍，且风险也不会那么大，我们不希望杠杆会破坏我们的避险位置。\n\n主持人：伯克希尔的杠杆，无一例外都是没有提前还款要求的资金，也就是“稳定的钱”。假设你开一家新店，当然是使用杠杆，没有资本，谁不想拥有一个没有存货的企业呢，对吧，在开店的第一天就欠供应商大量资金，而这些货物却迅速卖出。你怎么看？\n\n芒格：这样的情况终究会出现反转。\n\n主持人：你怎么看债务？\n\n芒格：现在许多制造业公司可以强制供应商承担所有的库存成本。这些制造公司通过与供应商的合作，将库存负担转嫁给供应商。\n\n主持人：回到合作伙伴关系的话题，David和我已经成为这个播客的合作伙伴10年。当然这样的合作关系与投资不同，但仍然是一个需要共同完成的事业。与沃伦合作50年后，你对建立持久的合作关系油什么建议？\n\n芒格：如果你喜欢彼此并喜欢共事，这会很有帮助。但我不使用任何一种公式。许多长期合作良好的伙伴关系之所以能够持续，是因为一个人擅长一件事，另一个人擅长另一件事。他们自然分工，每个人都喜欢他正在做的事情。\n\n比如Costco的Jeffrey Brotman和James Sinegal，Brotman非常聪明但不是零售商出身，当所有董事会成员决定让Brotman担任董事长兼CEO的时候，Sinegal表示反对。那是一次非常不愉快的董事会会议也是一次大内斗，后来Brotman还是让步了。\n\n主持人：这次内斗是在你加入董事会后吗？\n\n芒格：是在之前。\n\n主持人：你认为，你和沃伦并不居住在一个城市对于你们长期维持的伙伴关系是有利的吗？\n\n芒格：对我来说可能有所帮助，但是巴菲特与所有人都保持着非常紧密的关系，且每周六都会在伯克希尔总部吃午餐。我和巴菲特在年轻时有很多共处时光，因为那时候没有那么多事可做。随着年龄的增长，他们有更多的事情要做，生活中的其他事情也增多。这跟年轻的时候是不同的。\n\n投资成功是非常困难的，在风险投资领域，一次又一次地投资成功几乎是不可能的。\n\n//05 VC行业整体做得很差\n\n主持人：你对风险投资（Venture Capital）有什么看法？\n\n芒格：一些项目可能变得非常火爆，你必须快速决策，所有人都只是在赌博。\n\n主持人：你认为VC在社会中是否发挥了其应有作用？\n\n芒格：没有，我认为VC行业整体做得很差。\n\n剩下的一部分查理芒格关于VC的看法并未录音，但话题转向了比特币。\n\n主持人：关于比特币，你在很多评论中都提到了，我很好奇你对这个特定角度有何看法：比特币作为一种独立的价值存储方式而不与国家挂钩，是否是一件好事？\n\n芒格：对全球而言，拥有一种全球范围内接受的货币是有益的。在过去，英镑曾是国际投资领域的主要货币，然后逐渐转向美元，并且现在仍然以美元为主。一些国家比如中国拥有大量美元储备，因为他们购买美国的产品和服务，而美国可以自主发行美元。\n\n主持人：那对于那些无法获得美元的普通人又该怎么办呢？\n\n芒格：当人们手头有足够资金时，他们总可以获得美元。美元是很容易被换取的，无论你身在何处，都可以轻松地获取。\n\n主持人：回到风险投资在社会中所扮演角色的话题，如果你可以设计一个完美的系统来为一个国家提供资金，你会如何做？\n\n芒格：VC做好了，这是一个非常合法的业务。如果你想给正确的人权利并培养他们，你就要帮助他们。你知道这场游戏的诀窍，所以你可以帮助他们做好生意，但又不会过多干扰他们。他们会讨厌你。总的来说，在接触过大量来自VC的人之后，企业中的人其实往往会很讨厌这群VC。 \n\n他们不觉得VC是他们的合作伙伴，不觉得这群VC是在帮助他们，相反，他们认为VC只关心自己，所以他们不喜欢这群VC。\n\n主持人：那是否有其他可能的运作方式呢？\n\n芒格：在伯克希尔并不是这样的。伯克希尔的策略并不会因为其他公司提高价格而轻易投资。如果某个业务存在问题，而伯克希尔无法解决这些问题，我们可能会出售这个业务。如果某个业务是相当不错的（a halfway decent business），伯克希尔通常不会出售它。这种策略有助于建立声誉并维持长期的商业关系。\n\n主持人：买入并持有策略是否是让投资者与资产管理者之间利益和目标达成一致的关键因素？\n\n芒格：许多人都按照标准方式处理事务，律师们使用标准文件。在特定的投资环境中，大多数人都取得了相似的成果。你不想通过欺骗投资者来赚钱。很多风险投资公司采用了不道德或剥削性的方式来盈利。世界充斥着类似高盛合伙人们成立的私募基金，他们筹集了数十亿美元或类似的金额，对投资者收取2%的管理费以及其他费用。这种做法使他们能够获得丰厚的回报。但是投资者并没有获得很好的回报。\n\n主持人：你认为这是基金管理费结构的问题吗？\n\n芒格：除非你能够取得非同寻常的投资成果，否则不应该收取额外的费用。假装能够取得出色的投资结果比实际取得这些结果更容易，因此风险投资业务吸引了不适合这一行的人，那些将风险投资视为获取高额回报的手段，而不是为了真正的投资成功。那些从风险投资中赚取最多钱的人往往类似于投资银行家，决定要进入哪个热门新领域。\n\n主持人：那你认为大型捐赠基金应该如何做呢？\n\n芒格：它们已经开始行动了。这些捐赠基金表示他们仍愿意支付高额管理费，但在基金的下一个投资周期投入两倍的资金且不会支付任何管理费。这意味着管理费降低了50%，这种费用结构的改变正在美国各地发生。高额管理费让他们感到愤怒和被误导，同时认为这样的费用结构不合理。\n\n// 06 投资越来越难了\n\n主持人：对于刚才你提到的关于风险投资的问题，目前市场上资金充裕且竞争激烈，当前的投资环境与过去的“Cigar Butt”（便宜股）时代相去甚远，当前市场是否还存在低估的、有价值的投资机会吗？\n\n芒格：会有人发现一些机会，但这变得越来越难了。我认为最简单的案例之一是Home Depot决定模仿Costco的商业模式，并把它直接放到家具领域。这是一个很好的商业决策，Home Depot因此也赚了很多钱。\n\n主持人：还有谁在模仿Costco的商业模式吗？\n\n芒格：还有另一个，Floor & Decor，它们在其地板产品的销售上模仿Costco但不断添加各种其他品类或许会成为问题。\n\n主持人：为什么沃尔玛没有竞争过Costco？\n\n芒格：他们太执着于已有的想法，这是每个人的困扰。他们就是无法接受新事物，因为空间已经被旧的想法占据了。他们形成了购置地产的习惯，即使那些地方原本毫无价值，因此入驻成本经常为零。而且它们知道如何建造大型店铺，这就是它们的策略。\n\n因此对他们来说，入驻富裕地段并因此付费让他们感到被冒犯。Costco只专注于富人居住的好地方，而沃尔玛多年来对此未采取任何行动应对，这是一个严重的错误。\n\n主持人：你认识沃尔玛的创始人Sam Walton吗？\n\n芒格：我没见过他，我认识他其中一个儿子。他把Walton Enterprises分成了六部分，因此他们从来没有缴纳过太多税。\n\n// 07 比亚迪是个奇迹\n\n主持人：说说你对于汽车行业和汽车制造业的看法。\n\n芒格：现在进入汽车行业并获得高额利润十分困难，没有人知道谁会取成为最终的赢家。电动汽车的出现彻底改变了整个汽车行业，并且进入需要大量的资本投入。汽车销售的方式也发生了变化，加之汽车制造业中强大的工会存在。所以他甚至没有关注汽车行业。\n\n主持人：由于电车颠覆式的创新，你认为今天的汽车行业相比于50年前更值得投资吗？\n\n芒格：也许对于一两家真正优质的电动汽车企业而言是的。但对于其他公司肯定不是。\n\n主持人：你觉得比亚迪是这一两家之中的吗？\n\n芒格：比亚迪是个奇迹。那个家伙（王传福）每周工作70个小时而且智商超高。他能做到你做不到的事，他可以看着其他汽车制造商的零部件搞清楚如何制造它们。\n\n主持人：你投资了现代汽车，这项投资对你来说怎么样？\n\n芒格：他们也很聪明。我损失了一些钱但是不多，我很固执，一直坚持到几乎回本才卖掉。\n\n08// 日本是一个显而易见的投资机会\n\n主持人：关于伯克希尔对日本商社的投资，为何巴菲特在日本的投资是不二之选？\n\n芒格：这是一个显而易见的投资机会。如果你像巴菲特一样聪明，也许一个世纪有两三次，你就会得到这样的想法。日本的利率10年来每年才0.5%。而这些公司确实是根深蒂固的老牌企业，他们拥有所有这些廉价的铜矿和橡胶基地，所以你可以提前10年借到所有的钱，去购买股票，并且支付5%的股息。 \n\n不用投资、不用思考，就有大量的现金流，你多长时间才能找到这样一个机会？如果你能在一个世纪里获得一两次这样的机会，你就足够幸运了。我们可以做到这一点——因为伯克希尔的信用，但是其他人都做不到。 \n\n芒格：提醒我了，我最近有研究过耐克这家公司。但我不喜欢这种时尚公司。如果是爱马仕我会投资，但除此之外我并不会想要投资一家时尚公司。\n\n//09 大品牌拥有强大的定价权\n\n主持人：对于LVMH这家公司，你怎么看？\n\n芒格：如果你有足够的时间、耐心和优秀的能力，你可能能够用一生的时间或者三、四代人的时间达到类似LVMH这样的成功。然而，即使有这么多时间，要成就像他们一样成功的事业也并非易事。\n\n主持人：你认为爱马仕和LVMH这些世界上最好的品牌他们持久价值是什么？是什么让他们经久不衰？\n\n芒格：他们拥有品牌忠诚度，且花了一个世纪才做到这一点。\n\n讨论转向将Kirkland Signature与爱马仕（Hermès）品牌进行比较。\n\n主持人：你如何看待品牌的价值？\n\n芒格：我们很难不喜欢品牌。因为我们曾经有幸以2000万美元的价格买下了喜诗糖果，这是我们的第一笔收购。我们很快发现可以每年将价格提高10%而且无人在意涨价与否。我们在没有提高销量的情况下提升了利润。在这40年左右的时间里，我们每年将价格提高 10%。这是一家非常令人满意的公司。\n\n不需要任何新的资本投入，这就是它的好处。我们买下它前后，公司的基本情况没有什么变化，仍然拥有两个大厨房和一些租赁店。当Charlie See的长子Laurence See去世之后，由于See family需要支付高额的遗产税，所以他们迫切希望出售公司。1972年我们购买喜诗糖果的时候，它的税前收入只有400万美元。\n\n主持人：所以购买机会只出现在See family需要流动性来支付遗产税的时候？\n\n芒格：我们之所以知道这件事是因为Charlie Se和Blue Chip Stamps的一位投资顾问Robert Flaherty在去往夏威夷的游轮上相识。我们向Robert支付了一笔发现费，尽管从那以后我们再也没有支付过。\n\n主持人：你怎么看喜诗糖果或者爱马仕所在的品类中由品牌决定定价权\n\n芒格：我认为购买像这样的公司的机会非常低，因此自己根本不会去寻找。我只相信并寻找那些我认为有可能找到的投资机会。\n\n主持人：你怎么看其他品类中那些知名品牌呢？比如包装食品或者其他\n\n芒格：有很多专业投资者除了知名品牌的股票其他什么都不买。他们通常从雀巢开始，然后只是查漏补缺。他们可能相对市场平均表现略好，但并不会取得巨大的成功。\n\n主持人：为什么亨氏能够拥有定价权但是卡夫却没有？\n\n芒格：这很有趣。某些品类的品牌对消费者来说非常重要，例如亨氏番茄酱，人们可能因为特定品牌的口味而改变品牌选择，愿意为其支付更高的价格。因此，我们可以提高亨氏番茄酱的价格。然而，对于其他产品，如卡夫奶酪，人们可能不那么关心品牌，因此试图提高价格可能会导致市场反感，包括最终的消费者（主妇）。\n\n主持人：因为酱汁是难以模仿的独特风味，是商业机会，所以这会带来定价回报。\n\n芒格：是的。人们会习惯并且喜欢上。这种情况在韩国也发生过，一个中国人掌握了每种主要酱汁95%的市场份额。\n\n主持人：可口可乐也是这样吗？\n\n芒格：是的，当然。\n\n// 10 成功人士三要素\n\n主持人：有什么是99岁的你相信但是70岁的你不会同意的？\n\n芒格：在70岁的时候我知道投资很难，但我现在知道到底有多难了。但一些收取高额管理费和分成的投资人会说这很容易，并开始自欺欺人，但投资非常难。\n\n主持人：如果回到三四十岁，你还会选择投资行业吗？\n\n芒格：或许会的，因为这符合我的天性。但我的确不喜欢高额管理费和分成的模式，更愿意用自有资金来投资，我认为这种方式更好，因为能带来更大的自由。这样就不用被迫与投行、投资顾问和VC打交道，就不需要其他人。富有的目的之一是不再需要依赖他人。\n\n主持人：如果你和巴菲特现在都是30岁，你们开始一起工作，你认为你们还会打造出与今天的伯克希尔类似的公司吗？\n\n芒格：不，我们不会。几乎所有取得杰出成果的人都具备三个要素：非常聪明，非常努力工作，非常幸运。如果你早早开始并且长时间不断尝试，也许最终你会具备其中一两个要素。\n\n主持人：如果今天重新开始，保险仍会是你的选择吗？\n\n芒格：这取决于性格特点。保险对于某种性格的人是理想的，它需要极大的耐心和时间来获得回报。而且需要长时间与对手进行竞争，赚钱十分困难。\n\n主持人：我曾经听到过你的观点，一旦你有足够的财富来自负风险，你应该尽量不再购买保险。\n\n芒格：想想那些因过度饮酒后出现问题然后向保险公司提出巨额索赔的人，为什么要支付自己的份额来弥补那些不明智行为的人的损失。\n\n主持人：你现在有保险吗？\n\n芒格：我没有火灾保险。\n\n主持人：你有汽车保险吗？\n\n芒格：我必须这样做，只有这样才合法。\n\n续...见下

（后文有详细解释），对于其它ALT适用性会更低。但作为经济体的主要参考，如果美国进入全面下跌的时候，可能会因为影响到资金的流动，而影响到所有风险资产的走势。以下所有数据均为月平均数据。所有计算结果都由月平均数据得出。\n\n我们看到的是从1980年开始的数据，其中深蓝色的线条代表的是美国联邦基金利率，线条的上行走势就是我们俗称的加息，下行走势就是降息，高位的横线就是暂停加息，橙色的线条代表的是标普500从1980年开始的走势，这些都是基础。从内容中我们选取了五个有代表性的时期来作为我们分析的基础数据，首先我们先看标注为加息的周期，数据中是包括了2022年至2023年加息的美国自1994年以后的五次加息周期，从这五个数据中可以发现，所谓的加息牛其实并不是只有2022年的这次才出现过，实际上从历史数据，甚至是从有史以来的数据都能发现，加息的时候美股从结论上来说都是上涨的。\n\n尤其是我们从上一周期的2015年11月到2018年12月的加息周期来看，标普500从低点到高点上涨了50.81%，而从加息开始到暂停加息标普500上涨了20.5%，在2022年到2023年的加息周期中标普500从低点到高点上涨了27.98%，而从加息开始到暂停加息标普500上涨了4.91%。甚至我们在往前看到从1994年开始的加息中，每次加息的过程中标普500都是在上涨的，所以这次加息过程中美股“加息牛”是非常正常的情况，加息上涨也是我们研究宏观指标非常重要的一个环节，以后必然美国还会进入加息周期，下次我们就可以知道加息并不可怕，加息过程中到暂停加息的前上涨几乎是100%的。\n\n另外我们在看五次暂停加息的周期，因为目前的暂停加息周期还没有完成，所以我们看的历史数据中是不包括现在这次的，在过往的六次暂停加息中，2018年12月到2019年6月的周期中，标普500从暂停加息开始到降息前上涨了17.35%，2006年7月到2007年9月的周期中，标普500从暂停加息开始到降息前上涨了19.5%，1997年4月到1998年9月的周期中，标普500从暂停加息开始到降息前上涨了26.92%，而且从暂停加息开始到峰值共上涨了41.49%，1996年4月到1997年2月的周期中，标普500从暂停加息到降息前上涨了18.22%，1992年10月到1994年2月的周期中，标普500从暂停加息开始到降息前上涨了11.57%。\n\n只有在2000年6月到2001年1月的这个暂停加息的周期中，标普500从暂停加息开始到降息前才下跌了6.49%。所以我们可以看到，六次明显的统计中，有五次在暂停加的时候，标普500是处于上涨的状态，这还不算在历史中有几次短暂暂停加息的时间，但总的来说，从历史数据来看美联储进入暂停加息以后，标普500上涨的概率超过83%（实际会更高）。也就是说很大的概率中在本次的暂停加息，也就是一直到市场预期的2024年6月标普500上涨的概率还是很大的，而如果按照2023年的9月的点阵图来看，很有可能这个时间会延长到2024年9月，当然这些都是预期数据。\n\n所以从我们现在获得的这部分数据来看，从美联储开始加息一直到暂停加息的时候，美股上涨仍然是主旋律，而这也是我们目前经历的时间，接下来就是降息了，同样我们从1989年6月以后的降息周期来看，可以发现标普500上涨了31.67%，1998年短暂的降息过程中标普500还是上涨了20.86%，但接下来从2001年开始，风向就开始出现了变化，从2001年1月开始降息一直到2003年7月暂时回到1%的底部，标普500下跌了27.5%，其中在高速降息的同时，标普500的最大下跌量达到了40.32%，只有在快速降息结束后，标普500才开始出现逐渐反弹。\n\n同样在接下来的2007年9月到2009年1月的降息过程中，标普500下跌了45.91%，周期中的最大跌幅达到了52.56%，然后就是最近一次的2019年6月到2020年4月的降息周期中，虽然标普500仅下跌了1%，但是在降息过程中的最大跌幅却达到了20%，至此我们从五次记录中可以看到有两次降息的时候标普500是上升的，而三次的时候标普500是下跌的，当然因为2001年以前的情况更复杂一些，所以实际上2001年以前的降息过程中确实标普500上涨为主，但是从2001年以后三次从降息开始到结束，标普500都是处于下跌的情况，尤其是在降息的过程中标普500出现的跌幅会更大一些。\n\n所以我们可以得出一个结论，就是从历史数据，尤其是从2001年以后的历史数据来看，美联储降息的过程中标普500是以下跌为主，降息的越急促，标普500的下跌就越快，一直到降息的尾声标普才会开始反弹，而往往到了低利率区间的时候美联储会从经济紧缩转变为经济宽松，也就是放水，往往低利率期间风险市场是上涨最快的阶段，那么回到我们在前边的假设，如果真的有所谓的“最后一跌”，那么标普500也就是美国股市出现的时间大概是从降息开始，降息的幅度越大，标普500下跌的概率就越高，下跌的幅度也就越大。\n\n那么从现在市场的预期来看，市场认为2024年7月开始降息，那么如果是缓慢降息的话，很有可能是从2024年第四季度开始美股会出现下跌的情况，但如果是极速降息的话，很有可能第三季度就会出现美股下跌的情况，但这还不算完，我们还需要引入一个参考数据，来更准确的预估美股的走势，这就是美国的失业人数，也就是深绿色的波形背景，并且我们需要注意到，往往是失业人数上升的情况下，美股下跌的概率就很大，从我们看数据的1989年开始，失业人数和标普500并没有直接的关系，但是从2000年开始可以明显的看到只要是失业人数（失业率）上升，那么美股就会进入到下行阶段。\n\n甚至可以说，从2000年以后，只要短期内失业人数上升的越多，那么美股下跌的就越狠，而且从数据中也能看到，失业人数主要的上升期基本都是在降息阶段，而失业的数据我们在讨论加息的过程中已经说过很多次，目前因为地缘冲突的原因导致了包括石油和木材（房屋建筑）方面的原材料上涨，而这些来自于供应端的问题又是美联储无能为力的，所以美联储的控制通胀是通过降低需求端来倒逼供应端降价，而需求端的控制就是降低就业人数，提升失业率，虽然残忍一些，但这就是美联储的手段，这也是为什么美联储一直希望能够提升失业率，给就业市场降温的原因。\n\n即便是现在风险市场预期美国的经济不会出现衰退，就是因为即便是高利率的时期，美国的失业人数（失业率）仍然是在历史低点，所以美国的经济学家普遍认为美国的经济韧性很强，就业市场非常的旺盛，美国短时间内没有看到会进入到衰退的窗口，但如果我们假设会有“最后一跌”，那么失业率就必须要按照美联储预期的一样大幅上升，在预期美联储预期会达到4.5%的失业率，这个失业率仍然是非常低的一个数据，大概是2000年到2003年失业的人数的一半。这么来看的话，即便是真的会有“最后一跌”，那么很有可能标普500最后一跌的幅度不会很大，可能在15%左右。\n\n但如果失业人数继续上升，失业率达到5.5%左右，那么标普500的“最后一跌”最大振幅可能会和2000年到2003年（失业率5.5%）一样，达到30%左右的下跌。而如果失业率达到了10%，那么很有可能标普500下跌的最大振幅在50%左右，这个数据就和2007年到2009年（失业率10%）会非常相似。到这里还没有完，仍然有一个数据需要考虑，从1989年开始，美国一共进行了四次大规模的降息，分别是3年4个月，2年6个月，1年4个月和10个月的时间，而往往来说，加息的越高，降息的时间就越长，目前的联邦基金利率是5.5%，上一次接近这个利率的是2007年的5.25%。\n\n当时的美联储用了1年4个月的时间将利率从5.25%降低到0.25%，也是在这个时期，标普500的最大下跌幅度是在52.56%，如果按照这样来计算的话，这一次大概降息周期可能会在1年到2年左右，取决于美国是否会进入到金融危机的局面，要知道2007年就是出现了金融危机，当时美国第二大次级房贷公司新世纪金融公司就是这时候倒闭的，还有就是大家熟知的雷曼兄弟也是在这个时期倒闭的，而是否进入金融危机时代表的美联储会加速降息还是会缓慢降息的决策，经济越出问题，降息的幅度越大，美股的影响（下跌）越大，相反，经济越稳定美联储降息的幅度可能会更小，对风险市场的刺激可能会更低。\n\n这还不算完，从2000年以后，美国的三次失业率上涨，分别经历了3年2个月，2年5个月和3个月（疫情）的时间，除去2021年的疫情导致的失业率上升以外，失业率上升以及美联储降息的重合时间，最长的在2年6个月，最短的也要在1年4个月的时间，而这段时间往往都是下跌最严重的区间，所以到这里，我们基本整理出，按照目前美联储和市场的预期，如果真的有“最后一跌”，那么美股很有可能会在2024年的第三季度出现，一直到可能持续到2026年的第一季度，当然这取决于美国经济是否能维持正常，而且从历史来除了疫情以外美国最短的降息周期都是一年零四个月。\n\n这里还有一个考量点，就是2024年的美国大选，对中期大选还有记忆的小伙伴应该还记得，我当时曾经出过一篇专题，讲的是从历史数据来看，中期大选对于风险市场已经连续56年14届（到现在已经是60年15届）有正面的支持作用，每次中期大选前如果美股跌的越厉害，那么中期大选后三个月到半年内美股上涨的越好，对应的时间正好的2023年2月到5月，这段时间不但是美股上涨的很好，就连币市都从16,000美元上涨到26,000美元左右，市场的共通性还是存在的，而从历史数据来看，美国大选虽然对市场的影响没有中期大选那么大，但仍然更多的时候是有正面作用的。\n\n从1992年开始的历史来看，只有2000年的美国大选以后美股是出现了下降的趋势，其它的七次大选以后，在平均两年多的时间内标普500都是处于上涨的趋势，而且最近五次大选后标普500的平均上涨（到下一次下跌前）都是在45%左右，而且除了2008年是在大选以后四个月才开始标普500的上涨，其它的六次中（2000年不算）全部都是从大选月（十一月）开始，标普500就出现了上涨，这种情况下我们在结合前边说过的降息和失业数据对比来看，2000年和2008年都是处于美国大选和降息的双重重合区间，至此我们又能得出一个数据。\n\n如果在2024年大选前，美联储能够实现联邦基金利率回到0.25%，那么大选以后美股整体上涨进入牛市的可能性会较大，但是这种在可能性确实太低了，即便是2024年7月就开始降息，也不太可能4个月就降低525个基点，甚至有可能在大选前才刚刚进入到降息阶段都有可能，那么2000年的走势很有可能会被复制，即便是有大选的加持，可能美股也会陷入到维持一年多的下降，那么美股牛市的到来可能就是在2025年的年底开始，而在2025年以前美股很有可能会有进入到下跌的阶段。\n\n所以从历史，结合了美国大选，美联储降息，美国失业人数（失业率）这三个方面的数据来看，要么就是历史没有任何重合性，美股不会进入到下跌的状态，但如果有所谓的“最后一跌”的话，那么从2024年第三季度到2025年第三季度可能会是美股下跌最严重的区间，这一年中美股的跌幅可能会在30%左右。其中已经包括了可能美联储的降息时间，美国失业人数的上升，美国大选对于经济的支持的因素，但经济毕竟不是做数学题，经济不能通过刻舟求剑和1+1=2来简单计算，所以这份数据的只能做为参考，并不能作为一定会发生的依据。\n\n到这里还没有完，对于我们绝大多数的小伙伴来说，看的并不是美股，美股的涨跌或者牛熊也未必是币市的涨跌或者牛熊，尤其是2024年即是BTC的减半周期，又有BTC和ETH的现货ETF加持，而且币市的体量还很小，并不一定会按照美股的剧本走，那么对于币市来说，我们也有参考点，首先是黄金在2024年11月通过了ETF以后，12月继续上涨，但1月就开始出现了回调，一直到2004年9月以后才回复了上涨趋势，如果BTC也沿用黄金的走势风格，那么不论是2024年1月还是3月通过 #Bitcoin 现货ETF的话，大概率在2024年第二季度到第四季度之间是处于回调的阶段，当时黄金的回调是10%。\n\n第二个重要数据就是减半周期的数据，从历史来看，目前已经经历过三次减半，从开始到最高点，分别经历了1年，1年5个月和11个月（2021年高点仅计算到4月，11月考虑可能会受到期货ETF影响，所以不计算）。而且从减半开始到价格大幅上涨一般都会在5个月以后，目前的预期来看本次的减半大概是在2024年4月27日左右，那么五个月以后大概就是9月底，在结合前边所说的黄金ETF预测，以及美国的宏观情绪来看，不论 #BTC 的现货ETF是否能够通过，仍然是2024年第二季度和第三季度币市回调的概率可能会更大一些。\n\n其中不同的是，如果BTC现货ETF通过了，那么回调的价格可能会和黄金回调非常的接近，而且减半周期的行情开启很有可能会从40,000美元左右开启，结合现货ETF带来的资金量来看，2025年有望突破历史新高，而如果现货ETF没有得到通过，那么减半周期的行情开始有可能会在26,000美元左右作为起点，在2025年想要突破历史新高的可能性就较低，除非是美联储在进行史无前例的放水行动。所以最终总的来说，如果整体风险市场都有“最后一跌”的话，2024年第三季度和第四季度可能是整体风险市场下跌比较惨烈的时候。\n\n全文结束，再次重申，所有内容都是建立在历史数据的刻舟求剑基础上，并不代表会一定发生，也不代表文中给出的时间就是准确时间，实际的偏差可能会以季度来计算，受到的外力影响会非常的大，尤其是美国经济变化，降息开始的时间以及BTC现货ETF是否能被通过，都是会改变该预测的分母级数据，未来可以依据该数据逐步的完善和更加准确的预测时间，但目前该份数据并不具有交易指导作用，只能用来作为学习历史的参考数据，以此数据为基准产生的踏空或损失，我概不负责。\n\n本推文由

Lollapalooza倾向\n\n多种心理倾向共同作用造成极端后果的倾向\n\n解释：当多种倾向联合起来，共同作用于同一个方向时，他们会相互强化，彼此放大，产生核爆炸式的效应，查理芒格称之为 lollapalooza 倾向。\n\n实际产生的效果是 1+1>2的。"

            "full_text": "写在牛市到来之前——即熊市我们还能做什么？\n\n其实这些内容我早就准备好了，那时候大饼才28000，今天已经34000了，虽然说牛市还没来，但是相信以下的观点依旧适用。\n\n以下的内容分为几个维度：\n资产维度\n影响力/链接维度\n思考维度：牛市能赚什么钱\n准备维度：信用卡，杠杆，基础建设资源，等等\n学习维度：能储备什么技能，\n安全维度：保守，资产安全\n\n一：熊市可以做的事——资产维度\n\n盘点且面对自己的资产状况，不要逃避，即便很糟糕也接受，这个是很痛苦的事情，需要面对自己的资产状况，面对自己在低价可能没买入，甚至是在低价没钱卖入的情况。\n\n根据不同的资金量级可以选择不同的低风险套利，如defi套利，我觉得还是依旧有一些套利的地方的，只要能找，一定会找出来。\n\n能场外赚钱就多赚钱，赚不到就少花点，开源节流，我觉得即便赚很多钱还是保持朴实的生活\n\n目前的资产比例，什么时候满仓，想好各种情况的不同应对方法，就比如今天的暴涨，是否舒服，如果不舒服是什么原因，舒服的仓位还是最重要的。\n\n资金管理能力：假设别人给我一个亿，我怎么接住，这点其实是一个套利的团队，或者是工作室应该具备的，或者说应该思考的，就是如果一个活动来了，真的有人给你很多钱，你能否接住。\n\n如果没有能力，其实是很难赚到大钱的，正因为有能力才能赚到钱，不是因为赚到钱才有的能力。\n\n二：熊市可以做的事——影响力/链接维度\n\n如果是群主或者kol，努力经营自己的影响力，写作，直播，分享，其实今天的很多kol在一两年前可能都是无名之辈，影响力在这个圈子还是很重要的。它不仅能带来话语权，甚至会让钱来找你，所以这点还是要重视。\n\n如果是个体，可以找找有潜力且志同道合的人看看是否有可能一起搞事情的可能性。虽然说今天很多人都团队化了，但是依旧有不少人还是孤军奋战，也不是说一定要组团队，而是说可以多走出去，多交朋友，多学习，多去拜访优秀的人，多给别人提供价值，在这个过程中万一遇到合适的小伙伴，也许真的可以组织一个团队出来。\n\n总之要保持开放，多链接，也许今天的无名之辈在未来是名震一方的大佬，牛市大家都忙着赚钱，熊市是链接最好的时候\n\n还有就是和信任的朋友尝试着产生一点点的金钱链接，比如合作搞一个小项目，因为如果牛市来了，需要的钱都比较多，如果没有基础的信任，其实是很难让别人给你很多钱的。\n\n所以趁着行情还没起来，其实是一个很好的尝试合作的机会。\n\n三：熊市可以做的事——思考维度\n\n可以思考下如果牛市来了能赚什么钱？这点可以参考下小鑫的@xiaoxin_bit：web3散户可以赚什么钱，如果想的足够清楚，在牛市来的时候是不至于没有方向的，想的越清楚，到那时候就会有更少的迷茫和焦虑。\n\n并且在现阶段可以思考且尝试自己的能力圈，用最小的代价试错，比如有的人发现自己不擅长做什么打新套利，擅长冲土狗，捕捉阿尔法机会，这也是一个发现自己长处的过程。\n\n只有多尝试，多自己做，才能知道自己真的擅长什么，不然很可能会被市场淘汰。\n\n还有就是如果牛市机会很多，现在我需要什么样的人？什么技能储备？这里需要想清楚自己缺什么，需要什么，现在就可以去学习这样的技能，或者是去寻找这样的人才\n\n最后就是要想好怎么卖，卖多少，什么时候卖，很重要，很重要，真的很重要，不然一轮牛市下来，资产回撤，是很痛苦的。\n\n四：熊市可以做的事——准备维度\n\n基础建设的资源，比如KYC，基础建设设施的资源，推特，dc等。这种都是需要在多尝试做活动的时候多储备，多去花一点心思去盘点的。\n\n比如硬件和人力资源：比如大量的手机，电脑，足够大的场地，甚至是招兼职的资源等等，这些看着好像简单，但是如果真的有非常赚钱的活动的时候，其实是很难快速的能做好的，因为没有经验。\n\n所以有过经验很重要，有过经验最重要的就是去尝试，去做。\n\n如果可以的话，还可以准备些场外杠杆：💳，贷款，银行网络的人际关系储备等等，比如银行经理，这里是为了应对极端行情发生，万一满仓了，但是又暴跌了，怎么办？\n\n需要考虑好这方面的问题，多花些心思总不是坏事。\n\n还有就是健康的身体：健康是一，多锻炼，好好休息，为好的机会做准备，多锻炼吧，牛市的时候可能需要熬夜，现在保养好身体是非常重要的，现在每天锻炼锻炼，真的赚到钱也不至于没那个命去花钱。\n\n五：熊市可以做的事——学习维度\n\n对行业发展和热门叙事的理解和研究，明白什么项目可以对行业发展造成影响，这一部分是我在不断的投研过程中理解的，如果不了解这些东西，是很难去捕捉到一些阿尔法机会的。\n\n或者这么说，如果不了解这些，你凭什么去赚到钱呢？为什么你连行业的发展都不了解，还想着能赚到钱呢？\n\n多反问自己，反问多了，自己也就慢慢的明白了，哪有什么运气好，就是自己不够努力而已。\n\n还有就是对一个项目出来后快速且精准做决策的能力，这个是我最看重的能力之一，他需要大量的训练来打磨，包括，对项目深度研究的能力，比如项目数据，估值计算，简单的赔率计算等等。\n\n在牛市的节奏是很快的，项目也很多，如果有这种能力，可以更大概率的的去抓到机会，这种能力在我来看是牛市能赚到钱最核心的特质之一，非常重要。\n\n但他也是较难锻炼的，但是如果很简单的话，也没什么价值，我相信能否想明白且面对短期困难但是长期有效的事情，是人们不断拉开差距的因素之一。\n\n其次还有就是不同维度的基础技能储备，比如基础的编程技能，批量化技能，管理技能。\n\n如果需要批量的提现，自动借贷，需要的时候再去学就晚了，举个例子，上一轮猴地的时候，如果会自动借贷的话，可以在借不到ape的情况下，不断的去自动刷借贷，我当时就是储备了这样的技能，所以说运气好能借到了一些ape去参与，而不是顶着风险去买ape来参与。\n\n还有就是，随着一些人规模的扩大，一些管理的技能也是必备的，管理100个钱包和1万个钱包是完全不同的方案，这个就是只有自己做到有一万个的时候才能体会到的到。\n\n总之现在还有时间，多去储备一些技能，一定会用的上的\n\n最后就是多读书——大量阅读非虚构类书籍，会让人构成不同的思维模型，有助于决策。\n\n最近在读纳瓦尔宝典，还有有钱人和你想的不一样，其实这种书都会在做决策的时候多多少少的帮助到我，我读过对决策最有帮助的书之一就是《反脆弱》，这也是知识改变命运的案例之一。\n\n多读书，短期看不到效果，但是在某个时候他一定会帮到你。\n\n六：熊市可以做的事——安全维度\n\n熟悉且习惯使用硬件钱包，养成安全习惯，不然牛市赚来的钱丢了会很痛苦，我自己也曾经差点丢过钱，上一个牛市之前差点丢了20万人民币的uni。\n\n安全是一种习惯，需要保持这种习惯，这些工作其实是看不出来效果的，因为他没有发生，但是一旦发生了，就是不可挽回的损失。\n\n所以安全问题一定要重视\n\n还有就是保守主义：现阶段保证资金安全，不要轻易梭哈参与项目，保证活下去，活下去最重要，只要活下去，牛市就有机会。\n\n上一轮熊市在312的时候我所有的钱只够还信用卡的，但是坚持下来也是能赚到一些钱的，所以保证自己活着，别骚操作。别做那种可以让自己归零的操作，很重要。\n\n除此之外还有硬件安全：手机安全，电脑安全，保证自己工作的电脑只用来工作，别用那些下载过游戏外挂的电脑来储存资产啥的，玩游戏的电脑和工作的电脑分开。\n\n最后就是安全知识的学习和贮备：比如基础的链上安全知识，你要知道哪些人可能是骗子，哪些链接可能是钓鱼，需要大量的实战学习，多看，多总结。\n\n以上就是所有的内容了，有点多，但是在牛市到来之前，还是需要做好这样的准备的，这些准备做了可能短期看不到效果，但是长期来看他一定会在某一个重要的时候帮上你。\n\n总之，但行好事，莫问前程，希望新的一轮牛市和大家一起暴富"

            "full_text": "感谢同事帮我整理了昨天在 @binancezh 币安 Space 的问答。欢迎讨论。\n\n个人介绍：\n我是风险基金 Aperture Digital 的合伙人 Kay，在上轮周期也 lead 过一些 Solana 生态项目的投资，当时供职的机构也参与过 Solana 的早期投资。但今天的分享都是个人观点，不代表公司和我过去的雇主，也不是投资建议。\n\nQ1: DePIN 和之前的物联网，IoT 等概念有什么区别和更新？是新的价值洼地还是老酒装新壶？\n\nA: 首先第二个问题，肯定是价值洼地，而且是主线叙事。\n\n主线叙事的点是说，只有炒币用户，币圈是没有未来的。Multicoin / Messari 这些创造叙事引领叙事的西方机构/媒体，给这一轮的 Mass Adoption 寻找的方案就是 DePIN，只有像 Helium Mobile 这样加密原生的、能够触及非 crypto 用户的传统基建，才能让普通用户持有 crypto，然后把其中的一部分转化进来，炒币反哺。\n\n那么第一个问题，直观上目前最大的区别是我们现在讨论的 DePIN 应该说仅限于 Solona 的 DePIN 生态项目，而过去的众多项目大多数是想做 IoT 链，做链的逻辑，本质上看是套壳的 PoW，项目方一手矿机、一手币，当然他可能名字不叫矿机，比如是路由器，甚至说我们现在在一级市场上看到还有插线板，但核心是，这些能挖矿的设备，我们统称他们矿机，这些矿机，都是用金融产品的逻辑，换言之是用回本周期来定价的，不是用硬件价格来定价的。\n\n这样子就是一个 PoW 矿币的双轮模型，项目方卖矿机出货，然后用矿机收入拉币价，如果是在牛市周期里，币价继续涨，按照金融产品定价的矿机也可以继续涨，又或者说矿机不涨，但项目方有更多的退出流动性，从矿机这层出更多货。\n\n这本质上是个牛市的 ponzi。\n\n但这轮的 DePIN 还是有蛮大的不同的，那么我们从龙头美国移动 $MOBILE 为例看的话，他也有这层的矿币双轮模型，去卖 in-door 和 out-door 矿机，但是，他还有接入终端网络用户，也就是普通的，用 sim 卡和 esim 卡的用户加入运营商网络的这层消泡沫模型，而且，目前来看，这个模型是 Scalable 的，两个点，第一，Helium Mobile 的套餐是真的便宜。5 美金或者 20 美金一个月无限 call / data / text套餐，在美国真的是最便宜的套餐，我们同比的去看，甚至不去比较传统的美国四大运营商，就比如 Google Fi，最低配的无限流量套餐是 50 美金一个月；第二个，用户切换到他的套餐是真的方便，可能很多听众主要在亚洲，没有普及 eSIM，在美国新买的 iPhone 都是1 eSIM + 1 SIM 实体卡槽的，对 eSIM 的话，只需要下一个 Helium Mobile 的 App，就可以把套餐切过去。\n\n这整个模型，其实是双轮 PoW 矿机模型加上标准的互联网产品补贴 growth hack 模型，或者说降速旁式模型，比如早年的外卖补贴、打车补贴，都是这个逻辑。但是还多出来两层逻辑，一个是 luckin coffee 瑞幸咖啡的早期逻辑，他们在美股做股票增发、发债，用二级市场的钱回来继续做补贴，另一个是 MEME Coin 的逻辑，eSIM 用户如果开了 Dicovery Mapping，也可以获得 $MOBILE 奖励，这个就很像 PI 币的口号，类似于说，这是斯坦福打造的新的比特币，你只需要手机打开就可以挖矿，非常的容易在 TikTok 传播、非常的下沉性。\n\n总的而言，现在以 $MOBILE 为 DePIN，和过去的物联网项目的套壳 PoW 矿机模型以外，我看到了一个三轮的模型，PoW、二级市场补贴普通用户降速庞氏消泡沫、Solana 生态的主线叙事大 Beta。\n\nQ2: 该怎么找到这轮 DePIN 概念中的优质项目？如何区分一个 DePIN 项目是有发展空间和潜力的？目前这个阶段该如何布局 DePIN？\n\nA: 两种思路。一个对普通项目赚快钱的思路，两个核心点，早期参与和只买币不买矿机。\n\n另一个在牛市赚吃板块龙头 Beta 的思路，那么就要找真的 DePIN 项目，就要考虑除了 PoW 矿币模型以外，有没有消泡沫的手段，是不是降速旁氏。目前我看到的有且只有 $MOBILE 是叙事足够大的同时，又有跑通消泡沫的可能性。"

            "full_text": "发个Twi说一下个人FT初步的运营策略\n\n这几天学习了下FT各个大佬的运营策略，整体得出的结论是Key价格的“做市策略”重要性要高于赋予Key Utility的重要性，就像是“项目方在做事”远比不上简单粗暴的拉盘更能吸引人眼球一样。然而作为一个散户，这条路确实走不通，还是得回到Utility这条路上来\n\nUtility也学习和看到了各种不同的策略，最震撼的还是大有 @youyou5202 的AiDoge股权分红，这算是实实在在的Fi，甚至算RWA了，也只有AIDOGE创始人可以玩出这么豪横的玩法来，一般人无法复制\n\n每个人擅长的东西不一样，我个人二级市场的Alpha买卖或者K线分析之类的实在是菜的很，就不在FT里班门弄斧了，自身优势还是在行业赛道分析+一级市场。所以初步打算搞这么个运营的策略，也欢迎大家提宝贵意见。\n\n简单来说，持有我的Key你可以做什么呢\n\n知识星球风格内容类 -\n1. 向我提问 - 某个赛道，某个具体项目或者币种的观点之类（非币价涨跌），我每天都会固定花一些时间去看FT，有问题会尽量解答\n\n2. 我每1-2周会在FT里发一个近期看到的一级市场现状汇总，哪个赛道比较多，有没有发现什么新的赛道或技术创新之类，当然不会牵扯具体项目的名称\n\n3. 我的Twi一般都是长文，往往会是几个观点的聚合，FT里面不定期会发我对一些新老赛道的“短文观点”，有些可能是未来长文的组成部分，也可能是Twi上不会有的内容\n\n4. 在部分Twi上长文牵扯到的赛道，里面相关的一些具体的项目，在征得项目方同意的前提下我会放在FT里，这些项目有些是我们的portfolio，有些不是，有些属于潜在Portfolio（不是每个聊到的项目都处于融资阶段），Key Holder可以提前关注到一些优质项目\n\nFi类 -\n比较简单粗暴，也没有用Fomo3D之类的形式。我FT上每周手续费的30%会拿出来给三位Key Holder每人10%打过去。第一周会从最早买入的三位Holder开始发放，往后的每周根据BTC价格与上周发放时对比，如果BTC涨了就顺着最早买入的Holder顺序依次发放（已经发过的就先跳过），如果BTC跌了就从最晚买入的三位Holder顺序依次发放（同样已经发过的就先跳过）\n\n之前的手续费就不计算进去了，下周一的手续费-2.8就是本周的手续费收入\n\n合作类 -\n1. 如果你是Builder，在寻求融资，可以直接发给我Deck，跟我或是ABCDE投研团队约个会聊一聊\n\n2. 如果你是业内从业人员，我会在FT第一时间发布ABCDE未来计划举办的活动，黑客松之类的信息\n\n3. 如果你觉得自己是个人才，想来ABCDE工作，也可以直接在FT里发简历给我\n\n整体来说，我的个人运营策略还是偏内容类为主，给Key Holder定期去展示一个亚洲头部基金在这个行业内的一线视角与信息，可能对于各位二级市场的买卖帮助不大，零点几个以太我觉得还算OK，要是超过1ETH了我自己都会觉得贵，所以慎买 :)\n\n策略只是个初稿，保留随时修改的可能性\n\n最后附上我的链接和邀请码\n\nhttps://t.co/ULkbeKMGLX\n\nft-dt31bg4l\nft-p3moao12\nft-amxdhcxz"

            "full_text": "与孙老板@sunlc_crypto的交流收获\n\n本次上海行最后一天拜访了推特大V，孙老板@sunlc_crypto \n\n孙老板个子特别的高，人很和善，分享下我的收获。\n\n最大的启发：熊市，才是拉开差距的所在\n\n熊市是个积累、播种的过程，比如手中的本金积累、数字资产的积累，只有这时候买才是赔率最好之时、风险相对最低之时。\n\n但这些都不是立刻给予的，需要漫长的时间，很多人熬不下去。。。\n\n熊长牛短，牛市太浮躁了，那时候就是捕捉赔率最高的机会、日夜作战，那时候就是下金雨，需要拿盆去接，但是盆提前准备好了么？接金雨的人是只有自己还是有很多人？\n\n这些准备最好都发生在熊市。\n\n@孙老板 提到他们在Gala战役中大获全胜，核心原因是有https://t.co/RzkSGKsT8j的账号，这个蛮难申请的，但是gala的搬砖套利就半天的机会窗口，有账号、知道搬砖玩法就是可以捡钱。\n\n包括前几天早上开盘的bigtime，如果有海外kyc的okx账号，就是可以很低价格买到初始代币，否则就干瞪眼，我看到价格时候是0.025（目前0.21，最高到0.3+）\n\n所以，类似https://t.co/miFhFfsrSD、coinbase、okx海外kyc甚至hashkey等账号，牛市前我都要配齐。\n\n熊市的准备与积累，除了各种交易所账号，还有哪些？欢迎评论区里聊下～\n\n熊市也是不断增加武器、不断磨砺武器的过程\n\n上一轮我们办公室大都是靠交易所打新赚钱，但是下一轮还能那么赚钱么？\n\n我们是存疑或者说担心难以为继的，因为赚钱的方法一旦众所周知，收益就会大幅下降，参考币安的ieo收益越来越差。\n\n所以，熊市我们办公室在不断折腾，好多机会、热点都在尝试，不仅仅关乎赚钱（熊市更多是亏钱）而且就是在练兵、练团队磨合、对外合作等，我们相信，这些在牛市都可以放大机会的收益。\n\n最后，孙总也提到一点，让我警惕：\n\n熊末牛初别懈怠、别被熊市不赚钱的惯性带走敏感度\n\n任何机会尽可能的参与、感受，否则当一个大机会来临，自己懈怠了，身边人抓住了，那么很可能资产量就差了很多，很可能就没办法一起玩了。\n\n进一步我的思考是，如果身边的人（比如同一个办公室或者小圈子）都参与了一个项目，哪怕自己不看好，也要参与一些。\n\n因为自己的判断未必对，一旦自己是错的，其他人是对的，且这个项目最后超级赚钱，那么自己内心可能会很酸，进一步资金量可能会迅速拉开差距、后面就很尴尬。\n\n最后，孙老板@sunlc_crypto 一定得关注！哈哈\n\n欢迎关注老薛@laoxue_eth ，收获更多老板的启发。"

            "full_text": "与arb赚400万刀的P总交流收获\n\n本次上海行，源于参加七爷、张潇雨老师、金马哥组织的网球活动，由于跟腱还在康复无法参与，我就在此期间约了P总@pzong666  、孙老板@sunlc_crypto 上海小聚了一下。\n\n本次先分享与P总的收获。\n\nP总为人比较低调，但论拿到的结果绝对是大佬级别的存在，比如：\n\narb空投得到了400万刀的筹码\n\n他的经历更多写在了他的文章《与1000w擦肩而过 》，见：https://t.co/pOiv0wmCjq\n\n与P总的交流特别开心，也收获了很多，分享如下：\n\n1⃣️交流前的准备\n为了更高效交流，P总是看了我的《毕业十年》https://t.co/rDLXSypu3D看了我们办公室几人的推特，了解到我们的过去，这样更便于交流。\n\n所以，做推特蛮重要，有自己经历的文章也蛮重要，让别人认识自己。\n\n最后，与他人交流，尽可能看对方的经历，这样更便于双方交流。\n\n2⃣️交流的框架\nP总交流时候，分别从：\n\n过往经历、目前团队取得的结果、团队的痛点、经营的业务等角度做分享介绍，对外交流，这几个话题都很实用，可以学习。\n\n3⃣️杠杆与批量化\n无论是实体web2创业中的“连锁”，还是web3中的“批量上号”，核心是杠杆与复制，没有这个很难赚大钱。\n\n跑通最小闭环，算好数据，做好运营执行sop，然后迅速批量化。\n\n4⃣️运营机制\n我认为P总 团队竞争力最强之处在于运营机制。\n\n团队成员不拿固定工资的，很多的成本都均摊，决定了他压力很小，反脆弱很强，熊市艰难，看似不多的众多成本，日复一日，月复一月，最终导致大多数工作室难以为继。\n\n不发工资，反而以成本均摊、大比例分润的方式去管理团队，一方面让团队有干劲、责任感，另一方面让大家更有凝聚力。\n\n不仅仅是web3，连web2创业，P总 都选择最轻的SPY店入场，也是按劳分配没有固定工资。\n\nps、疫情期间，SPY按摩店是存活率最高最高的产业之一，也是因为没固定工资。\n\n所以，无论是创业还是web3工作室，经营机制决定了是否可以走得更远。\n\n最后，我们FutureLabs其实也是类似模式，不发工资的🤣\n\n5⃣️web2与web3并行\nP总 不仅web3撸空投、量化、打新等大把赚，还经营着不少web2实体产业。\n\n这些产业如上述提到很轻的SPY店还有月子中心甚至把一些三线城市进行了垄断。\n\nweb2的好处以前并未察觉，但这次给了我很多启发，比如：\n\na、人民币的收入\n有了这个收入就会减少出金等，那么安全性就有所提升。\n\nb、风险对冲\n如果自己所有资产、现金流均来源于web3其实还是很“脆弱”，若把一些分配到web2，那么实现了资产风险分散。\n\n当然，前提是具备web2创业可赚钱的前提，否则就是消费了。。。\n\nc、社会认同感\n这个也是最大启发，web3即便再赚钱也很难获得社会认同，因为没对社会产生直接的帮助。\n\nweb2公司招募一个员工意味着养活了一个家庭，十个员工就是十个家庭，着实就是服务于实体为社会做贡献，当到达一定的规模，也会获得一定的社会地位。\n\n其实，也是增加了很多我们自身的安全，因为收入来源可上台面了。\n\n下轮牛市后，我可能也会考虑学习P总，将一部分资产置换成web2的产业。\n\n最后，与P总的聊天真的十分开心甚至心流，也印证了“越牛逼的人越谦虚”。\n\nP总 推特是：@pzong666 值得关注甚至结交。\n\n上海行，除了拜访了P总，还有孙老板@sunlc_crypto ，会在下一篇中分享沟通的收获。\n\n欢迎关注老薛@laoxue_eth ，未来聆听更多大佬的分享！"

            "full_text": "为什么@ElephantStatus将会成为第一个穿越牛熊的神盘 🧵👇🏻\n\n1）什么是$elephant？\n$elephant是大象金融的主币，是由@tonyoncrypto和其团队在2021年推出的defi产品。早期机制主要由$elephant（高税分红主币）、$trunk（稳定币）和farm机制构成。这三个机制搭配很容易让人联想到Luna，但是区别于Luna的稳定币在脱锚的时候会铸造卖出Luna去回购稳定币，造成主币的巨大抛压，$elephant通过赎回队列和挂钩支撑策略执行对$trunk稳定币的支持，减少了$trunk产生风险时对主币$elephant的影响，风险可控，并使整个系统更加稳定。\n\n2）2022年4月发生了什么（黑客攻击）？\n2022年4月，Elephant Money的金库遭到黑客攻击，黑客索赔了$elephant并砸盘，导致Elephant Money金库损失约1100万美元的资金。核心原因是Elephant Money智能合约造币功能存在缺陷，因此本次黑客攻击被视为可索赔事件。事故发生后，团队立即升级了合约，解决了这一漏洞。\n\n3）新机制的开始-永恒复利和长期存钱罐\n2022年12月，团队开放了新的机制-future，用户存入BUSD从而获得超高的日化回报，每日0.5%。不存在任何形式的税费，并且合约100%不可变且在链上。这是一种相当出色的设计，用户购买future的90%稳定币会用来回购$elephant，这些购买的$elephant会放入elephant treasury。10%的稳定币会用来构成供用户提取奖励的缓冲池，用户需要提取奖励时会从缓冲池提取。提取金额大于缓冲池的1%则合约会自动卖出elephant treasury的$elephant代币兑付future奖励。\n\n乍一看这套机制非常像旁氏骗局，但是future的根据个人存款的TVL来进行复利，并且需要复投进行触发，将复利奖励累计进TVL。这里举一个简单的例子：初始投资2000U，如果等待10天，每天0.5%总计有100U奖励，此时复投一次200U触发复利机制，TVL会变成2000+100+200=2300U，第11天可以领取2300X0.5%。所以用户投资future的最好办法就是长期保持复投，触发合约，将复利的奖励累计进TVL。长期的复投+触发合约会不停地给future注入新的资金，90%用来回购$elephant保证主币的永远上涨。用户在第一年不断复投可以获得大于500%的年化回报，累计两年甚至三年复投可以实现资产的爆炸式增长。一次性地提取奖励会清空TVL，从而减少了整体的抛压。不会造成gamefi中常见的前期玩家回本后不断挖提卖的现象。\n\n截止目前future已累计获得了12M的存款，为投资者带来6M的复利，同时elephant  treasury中累计的$elephant已经价值超过80M足够兑付future的奖励。主币在2022年的黑客事件阴霾后也已经接近新高。\n\n4）墓地和国库组成的去中心化财政库\n\n$elephant机制中，50%的初始代币会进入Graveyard，交易税为10%，交易税的50%进入LP，另外50%分配给所有持币地址，因为Graveyard占据50%，所以有2.5%的交易税会进入Graveyard，Graveyard的机制中获取交易税分红超过51%时，会出售0.5%并和另外0.5%组成LP-这会帮助$elephant获得无限增长的流动性。elephant treasury组成的去中心化国库收入来源于（用户购买future的BUSD购买的$elephant+用户购买NFT的BNB购买的$elephant+用户铸造稳定币的BUSD购买的$elephant+$elephant的交易税分红+套利机器人）。国库和墓地的作用是不断从市场上减少$elephant的流通并不断增加LP，这些健全的机制帮助协议进行自动调节并不断扩张。\n\n5）社区和团队\n\nElephant money目前tg社区人数超过15K，youtube中介绍elephant money的视频超过30个，每当有新用户进入社区，OG成员会热情地帮助新用户解答问题，定期举办AMA也让所有投资者更加团结和清楚协议的最新动向。@tonyoncrypto从MIT毕业，任富达投资公司的网络架构副总裁，在项目被黑客攻击以后没有选择放弃，带领团队修复了漏洞，并且结合$elephant的现有模型设计了一套更加安全可靠的新机制，$trunk脱锚以后，宣布elephant treasury的5%将用于回购$trunk,给很多前期投资者增加了信心。\n\n#bsc #ElephantMoney  #DEFI"

Gitcoin 是否有空投？\n从去年下半年熊市开始，Gitcoin 空投的项目越来越少，所以从gitcoin 捐赠项目立刻获得空投的可能性比较低，需要等市场回暖，发币的项目方才会变多。\n\n2. 如果空投可能性低，那么参与Gitcoin捐赠的意义是什么？\n除开对公共物品的支持，参与Gitcoin一个大的意义是增加自己地址被大项目空投的权重，也就是养号，参考OP和最近的$TIA都给Gitcoin捐赠者有空投，以后其他二层空投或许也会参考地址的Gitcoin捐赠历史\n\n3.那些情况适合Gitcoin捐赠？哪些情况不适合捐赠？\n\n适合捐赠\n- 养号（尤其是新地址），捐赠gitcoin比在二层随便swap做日活有意义多了\n- 有自己看好的项目方，虽然熊市没有空投，牛市来了总有可能性\n\n不适合捐赠\n- 如果地址近期已经有多次gitcoin捐赠历史，再捐赠的边际收益不高\n- 捐很多项目（尤其是多地址捐赠），这种大概率是亏的，我自己最近每个地址捐2-4个项目（之前牛市的时候每个地址捐赠十几个项目）\n\n4. 捐赠指南\nhttps://t.co/ft6LkIJiwp\n\n最后，欢迎在👇🏻三个类别中给予我们相关项目支持！  \n\n1、Arbitrum Citizen轮 \nhttps://t.co/eLitQ2LHOs\n\n2、社区轮（Biteye） \nhttps://t.co/ig8A8DJ2lj\n\n3、开源软件轮（Mini Bridge）\nhttps://t.co/fGSLDiguCi"

We need fair launch”\n\n首先，我个人最认可的Crypto投资逻辑就是“叙事”，同时叙事是一个轮回，这个轮回是一个不断让自己相信，不断刷新自己认知的过程。\n\n铭文的叙事就是“公平发射的资产发行”，这个叙事成立的前提是市场逐渐厌倦了VC模式的项目启动方式，融资一轮又一轮，无尽的PUA，最后到散户手里渣都剩不下，那么这种现象是如何产生的？背后的原因就是筹码分配极其不合理，但也并非所有的VC项目都这样，这种现象的产生还是由于上一轮周期中用户对于VC的依赖和造神，导致的一种极端现象。\n\n不在沉默中死亡，就在沉默中爆发。\n\n于是“公平发射”在这个市场环境中被极度追捧。\n\n但这并不是永恒，当这种公平发射卷到极致直到没人愿意二级接盘，群内PVP互道傻逼的时候，就需要新的叙事介入。\n\n如果复盘DeFi Summer，流动性挖矿也是一种新的资产发行方式创新，当年你可以持有 ETH 、 USDT能白嫖到各种项目代币，而起初项目方也是不预留任何团队份额的，也曾经高喊出那响亮的句子“Fuck VC”，但是度过资产发行阶段以后，DeFi 进入了应用建设阶段，这是新的叙事接力。\n\n来到这个阶段，公平发射的后遗症开始显现，为了达到资产发行的公平性，团队手中没有筹码，开发动力和责任心逐渐丢失，长期的建设无法仅仅依靠一颗赤诚之心维持，那么怎么办？\n\n监守自盗，老鼠仓，各种花活、丑闻开始出现。这个阶段告诉我们，永远不要考验人性。\n\n很明显这个阶段需要资本进入，也需要合理的筹码分配，团队治理。\n\n所以，历史一定还会重演，只是换了舞台和演员。\n\n对于大多数散户来说，在资产发行阶段，是最容易完成原始积累的，因为在每个周期的这个阶段都是相对公平，同时门槛也比较低。但是对于老韭菜来说，尽管他们都明白这个道理，也总是会错过一轮又一轮，能够把握住的可以说是人中龙凤，原因就是人在刷新自己的思维固件的时候，很难做到返璞归真，无所畏惧。\n\n所以，新韭菜永远是冲冲冲，老韭菜永远是敬畏市场。\n\n我仍然坚信“叙事”的理论，至少这是我在Web3的生存准则，但所谓“叙事”并不一定非要实现，这个叙事只是让你更加相信你自己的判断，固化你的决策。\n\n比如，以太坊上至今也没有构建成《头号玩家》中的绿洲，整个Web3也并没有大家想象的那么去中心化，但是这个叙事依然存在，哪怕他永远无法实现，但能够让人一次又一次地趋之若鹜，这就足够了。\n\n这一点不在于你的落地能力有多强，而是在于你的故事是否性感，所以，叙事就是给自己洗脑的过程。如果你不相信某个“叙事”，你很难拿的住你手中的资产。\n\n那么，当你错过或者踏空的时候，给你一次重来的机会你能下多大的仓位，能拿住多久，这是一个很值得思考的问题。\n\n如果你不相信这个叙事，你将注定错过，没什么好遗憾的，把握好你认为对的事，因为那一天早晚会来。"

❤️，感谢你的支持。\n\n——————————————————\n\nBTC ETF 炒作暴涨的同时，BTC 衍生协议的生态也在快速地发展中。\n\n一个协议，只有同时具备炒作的热情，与社区中的正统性，才有可能成为真正有潜力 alpha。\n\n在加密世界中，资金从不是稀缺的，真正的竞争是正统性的竞争。这对寻找 alpha 来说至关重要。\n\n而 BTC 社区又是一个极度保守，信奉去中心化的社区，在 btc wizards 眼中，谁更清真，更符合社区文化，这个协议就更容易成功，毕竟 BTC OG 的买盘和号召力是惊人的。\n\n因此，我们从上述协议的方案入手，去理解不同协议的正统性与优势。\n\n——————————————————\n\n首先，要记住 BTC wizards 的教义：\n\n💎 不能对 BTC 网络本身进行修改和升级，这会让系统变复杂影响所有 BTC 的安全性。\n\n💎 不能对 BTC 区块扩容，这让 BTC 变中心化。\n\n💎 not your keys not your coins，自己的 BTC 自己持有，不能交给第三方机构。\n\n在理解这些协议之前，首先回答一个问题：为什么 BTC 的生态突然被价值发现？\n\n这里就需要讲到两个重要技术更新：\n\n⬆️ 首先是 2017年的隔离见证升级，这相当于将 BTC 的区块数据从 1 MB 扩展到了 4 MB，但该扩展的部分只能用于存储签名。\n\n⬆️ 一直到 2021 年底的 Taproot 升级，隔离见证中首次可以编写高级脚本，BTC 上可以写入复杂数据。\n\nBTC 在可编程性与可扩展性上获得了巨大的进步，一些包含复杂逻辑的协议开始出现，BTC 生态终于开始了下一阶段的里程碑，这是 2023 年的生态大爆发的主要契机。\n\n——————————————————\n\nOrdinals & BRC20\n\nordinals 协议出现彻底点燃了 BTC 生态，它的快速发展也与 Taproot 的采用互相促进。人们可以把 NFT 的数据通过编码后，写入隔离见证扩展的空间（每个区块 4 MB）中。\n\nNFT 的图像本身也被永恒地刻入 BTC 区块中，这比 ETH NFT 更去中心化，不依赖任何的第三方，就可以查看并转移（本质是 UTXO）这个 NFT。\n\nOrdinals 的实现使用了 BTC 的最基本功能，NFT 的转账也完全由 BTC 网络处理，因此非常符合 BTC 原教旨社区的理念。这很快点燃了社区的热情并被快速采用。但由于其艺术品的局限性，发展潜力也非常受限。\n\n很快，新的开发者改进了 Ordinals，模仿 ERC20 将 Token 的完整功能写入了 BTC 输出脚本，BRC20 由此诞生。\n\n但 BRC20 的输出脚本中只存储了数据，无法真的运行 Token 的功能如转账、铸造，因此我们必须借助第三方排序器，在 BTC 链下记录账本，并为脚本刻入新的状态数据。\n\n因此第三方排序器就变成了系统的薄弱点，BRC20 的转账不在 BTC 主链上执行，必须被拆成两步 BTC 交易执行(即在排序器中先归集再进行转账)，额外的复杂度让它产生了大量垃圾交易。\n\n因此它并不像 Ordinals 那样能被整个 BTC 社区接受，从诞生起就充满异议。但由于 token 的广泛适用性和更好的流动性，因此被炒作者追捧。\n\n由于正统性不强，没有 BTC 核心社区的支持，BRC20 及其改进协议不再有重大的创新和玩法出现。\n\n为了继续获得正统性，一些开发者开始了去中心化排序器的开发如 #Trac，这似乎是一个不错的方向，但我认为这仍然受限于整体框架，难以突破。\n\n——————————————————\n\nAtomical & ARC20\n\n@atomicalsxyz 是另一个在 UTXO 上刻入数据实现 Token 的衍生协议。\n\n不同于最初为 NFT 设计的 Ordinals，它从底层重新思考了如何在 BTC 上中心化的、不可篡改、公平地发行 token。\n\nAtomicals 以比特币的最小单位 sat 作为基本“原子”，每一个 sat 的 UTXO 用来代表这个 Token 本身，1 token = 1 sat。\n\n当验证一个 Atomicals 交易时，只需要在 BTC 链上查询对应 sat 的 UTXO 即可。ARC20 Token 的原子性和 BTC 本身的原子性保持一致，ARC20 的转账的计算完全由 BTC 基础网络处理。\n\n因此相比 BRC20， ARC20 的交易对第三方排序器的需求大大降低了，极大的提高了整个系统的去中心化程度。这更贴近了 BTC 社区的文化。\n\nUTXO 本身可以在 BTC 的交易中被组合，这让 ARC20 代币的可编程性更好。举例，由于 BTC 本质上也由 utxo 组成，因此 BTC 与 ARC20 的 swap 理论上只需要调换 UTXO 的输入与输出即可实现。\n\nAtomicals  另一个关键改进，是在 ARC20 的铸造过程中买入了 POW，铸造者必须使用 CPU 穷举计算出匹配特定前缀字符的 hash 值后，才能进行“打新”。这是一种更去中心化的公平分发方式。\n\nAtomicals 绑定 UTXO 的设计巧妙地规避了 BRC20 所面临的复杂度，更去中心化，更 BTC 原生，最关键是，更符合 BTC 社区的文化。\n\nARC20 和 $ATOM 还非常早期，还需要等待钱包、市场的完善，但在其正统性已经占据高位。\n\n在可能性层面，也有机会实现真正的 BTC 原生 DeFi。\n\n目前还未经历过大规模的炒作，仍具备较大的潜力。\n\n——————————————————\n\nRune & Pipe\n\n有趣的是，虽然 BRC20 脱胎于 Ordinals，但作为“异端”，一直受到创始人 Casey 的批评。\n\n不过在炒作的大趋势下，Casey 也提出了一种专门用于发行 FT 的铭文实现方式即 Rune。\n\n实际上 Rune 的设计可能也受到了 ARC20 的影响，选择直接在 UTXO 的脚本中写入 Token 数据，这包含了 Token 的 ID、输出与数量。\n\n显然，Rune 的实现与 ARC20 非常相似，将 token 转账直接交给 BTC 主网处理。区别在于， Rune 在脚本数据中写入了 Token 数量，这让他比 ARC20 具备更高的精度。\n\n但同时，复杂度也变得更高，难以像 ARC20 一样直接利用 BTC UTXO 的组合性。\n\nRune 的想法仅是个构想，#Trac 的创始人基于此编写了第一个可用协议，并发行了 $pipe。由于 Casey 较高的知名度，$pipe 承接了 BRC20 延续而来的炒作热情，快速地完成了第一波炒作。\n\nRune 的正统性相较 BRC20 更强，但想要被 BTC 社区接受依然艰难。\n\n——————————————————\n\nLightning 闪电网络\n\n闪电网络是 BTC 社区的正统性之王。从 2016 年开始，在很长一段时间里，BTC 生态的一半以上的开发者都在从事闪电网络的开发。\n\n闪电网络的基础是“支付通道”，该理念最早由中本聪提出(正统性 MAX)，交易双方通过多重签名将 BTC 锁定，双方在链下维护账本来记录交易。\n\n两两连接的支付通道形成了网络，不直接连接的两方也能跳转通道实现交易。闪电网络的确扩展了 BTC 转账的性能，让用户获得更好的体验。\n\n最终的 BTC 的结算只能在 BTC 主网上进行，所有的 coin 依然被公私钥体系保存。\n\n闪电网络基于密码学层面的设计，不需要升级 BTC 网络，也不要求 BTC 区块扩容，不给网络增加冗余，并严格遵守 your keys  your coins 的核心，同时网络自身的节点数量接近 15000 个。\n\n因此虽然需要依赖大量的第三方节点进行寻路、路由、配平通道状态等链下计算，但闪电网络的正统性依然非常高。\n\n但闪电网络的用例却很有限，仅能用于 BTC 支付，不能发行 Token，更没有智能合约功能，几乎与炒作绝缘。\n\n虽然在 2020 年前后，闪电网络获得了一波增长，并借助 Nostr 被整个加密社区熟知，但仍未被 BTC 社区外的公众所接受。在 Ordinals 爆火后，其用量也出现了大幅度的下降。\n\n清真，但是用例太少，无法承 BTC 资金，难以被用于炒作。\n\n——————————————————\n\nTaproot Assets (Taro)\n\n实际上，闪电网络一直在尝试扩展其用例，BRC20 的火热促使了 Lightning Labs 发布了 Taproot Assets，这着也是一个 BTC 上发行 Token 的协议。\n\n与 Brc20 等都不相同，Taproot Assets 仅仅在 BTC 主网的 UTXO 输出脚本中写入了 Token 的信息，没有存储这个 Token 的转账、mint 等功能代码。\n\nTaproot Assets 仅将 BTC 主网看作 Token 的注册表，并不是完全依赖 BTC 主网运行，因此这些资产必须被存入闪电网络中才能进行交易。\n\n因此  Taproot Assets 的 Token 必须依赖第三方的存储索引器，离开了存储索引器这些 Token 即将永远地丢失。\n\n因此用户要么自己运行一个 BTC 的全节点和 Taproot Assets 客户端，要么完全依赖一个中心化的服务器交易 Taproot Assets Token，这可能是目前 BTC Token 协议中最中心化的方案。\n\n由此，Taproot Assets 的打新方式也发生了变化。\n\n用户不能直接在 BTC 主网中发送交易自助地铸造 Token，而是有一个项目方地址一次性发行(或者叫注册)所有的 Token，然后再由项目方转入闪电网络进行分发。\n\n因此，Taproot Assets Token 都不是通过自由铸造的方式公平分发，往往需要一个中心化的项目方进行空投，项目方本身也可以预留 token，刚刚发行的 $trick $treat 就是如此。\n\n从去中心化角度来说，Taproot Assets 远不及之介绍的 Rune、ARC20 乃至 BRC20，但由于它由“正统性之王”的 Lightning Labs 发布，也的确没有给 BTC 网络增加负担，所以社区至少不至于反对。\n\n是的正统性就是这么飘渺的东西，掌握话语权的“教宗”说你清真你就是清真。\n\n但要注意的是，分发方式的变化，项目方的出现，导致了炒作逻辑的重要转变，更看重项目方的格局，无形间增加了炒作成本。\n\n——————————————————\n\nRGB\n\nRGB 是基于 BTC 和闪电网络的智能合约系统，属于是较为终极的扩容方式，但也因为其复杂程度而进展缓慢。\n\nRGB 将一个智能合约的状态转化为一个简短的证明，将证明刻入 BTC UTXO 的输出脚本中。\n\n用户可以通过验证这个 UTXO 来检查智能合约的状态。智能合约状态更新，就创建一个新的 UTXO 存储这个状态变更证明。\n\n智能合约所有数据完全在 BTC 链下，由专用 RGB 节点运行，RGB 节点本身记录着智能合约的完整数据，并处理交易的计算量。用户通过扫描整条 BTC 链的 UTXO，来验证合约状态变化的确定性。\n\nRGB 的每一个智能合约都有单独的状态历史和数据，也就是说，RGB 本身没有链的概念，不同的智能合约状态并不交叉，这于 ETH 的智能合约共享状态不同。\n\n要进行多 RGB 合约的交互，必须借助于闪电网络来实现，比如多个 RGB 代币的 swap 功能。\n\n可以把 RGB 看作是 BTC 的 L2，这种设计的好处是利用了 BTC 的安全性来担保智能合约，但随着智能合约数量的增加，对 UTXO 封装数据的需求也会增加，最终也会不可避免地给 BTC 区块链造成大量冗余。\n\n2018年至今 RGB 仍处于开发阶段，没有可炒作的内容，USDT 的发行方泰达公司是 RGB 的重要推动者，他们一直说要把 USDT 重新大量地发行在 BTC RGB 上。\n\n虽然 RGB 必须依赖第三方节点运行智能合约，但对每一次状态更新的 UTXO 记录，也让他成为了目前最安全最 BTC 原生的智能合约实现方式，正统性依然很强。\n\n——————————————————\n\nRSK & RIF\n\nRSK 可以看做 BTC 的 L2，本质是 EVM 结构的智能合约链。\n\nRSK 完全没有在 BTC 网络中写入任何东西，因此他的运行、安全性都不依赖 BTC 网络。\n\nRSK 只是通过 hash 锁将主网 BTC 垮链到自己的链上用作网络 gas。\n\n同时 RSK 的采用了与 BTC 相同的 POW 共识算法，因此 BTC 矿工也可以同时在 RSK 进行挖矿，赚取交易手续费 $RBTC。\n\n可以看出，RSK 与 BTC 的关系几乎是聊胜于无，生态的联系也很少，$RIF 与 RSK 本身业务关系也不大，它的上涨充分说明 BTC 生态的炒作热情，和可炒作标的的稀缺。\n\n——————————————————\n\nStacks & SBTC & STX\n\nStacks 可以看作是 BTC 的智能合约侧链。\n\n与 RSK 不同，Stacks 有自己的区块奖励系统，gas 与区块奖励都是 $STX。\n\nStacks 会在 BTC 出块的 10 分钟间隙里产出多个“微块”，当 BTC 出块时，一次性将这些区块的 hash 写入 BTC 交易的脚本中。\n\n同时，矿工要成为 Stacks 的节点，需要在主网质押 BTC 获得资格，奖励以 $STX 发送给矿工，而质押的 BTC 则分配给 $STX 的质押者。这相当于燃烧了 BTC 换取 $STX 代币，对于 BTC  maximalist，别说接受了，简直是“震怒”。\n\n虽然再正统性上收到质疑，但不得不说，$STX 在踩准叙事上做的非常好，且拥有最好的流动性，上涨也是十分亮眼。\n\n同时 Stacks 最近也上线了 SBTC 的网络，这其实就是通过 $STX 质押者的门限签名，在主网锁定 BTC，从而在 Stacks 链上产生 1:1 的 SBTC 资产，用于 DeFi。\n\n通过门限签名引入 BTC 资产的方式无需第三方桥，比起之前通过一个第三方使用 hash 锁 “not your keys not your coins” 的的方式，更加的去中心化，更加的清真。\n\nSBTC 的上线，Stacks 链的升级，虽然它的正统性并不高，但这些计划似乎也在引导 $STX 进行良性的炒作。\n\n——————————————————\n\nRollkit by Celestia\n\n$TIA 今晚就上线了，@CelestiaOrg 作为模块化区块链的推动着，也发行过一个基于 BTC 网络的 Rollup 叫做 Rollkit，同样是把 L2 数据写入到 Taproot 下的数据中。\n\n当然，这看起来更像是一个可能性展示，目前应该无法真的实际使用。\n\n——————————————————\n\nBitVM\n\nBitVM 是目前最 BTC 原生、最有潜力的且技术层面上最硬核的智能合约扩展方案。\n\n在不需要修改 BTC 网络的前提下，通过 optimistic rollups 运行一个支持通用计算的 VM 虚拟机，来实现 BTC 的智能合约。\n\nBTC 网络被用于运行 optimistic rollups 的欺诈证明，\n\n使用最基础的 hash 锁和 BTC 脚本操作码 OP_BOOLAND 和 OP_NOT，实现了一个简单的逻辑门。\n\n通过组合 BTC 的逻辑门，形成一个可以运算的电路，通过这个电路在 BTC 链上处理欺诈证明。\n\n而智能合约的运行在 BTC 链下，BTC 上仅运行 optimistic rollups 的欺诈证明。\n\n如果 optimistic rollups 出现问题，验证者可以在 BTC 网络中发起欺诈挑战，罚没直接通过 BTC 转账实现。这保证了 rollup 整体的安全性，而且对 BTC 主网来时是“可验证的”。\n\n从逻辑门起手搓电路，可见这种实现方式非常地硬核，这有一种在《我的世界》游戏里，用红石电路手搓计算机的美感。\n\n它完美地戳中了 BTC 死硬开发者和社区的心理，可以说是 BTC 智能合约层面的正统性之王。\n\n虽然目前 BitVM 还是处于理论的阶段，但同时引起了BRC20 与 Ordinals 的炒作者，与 BTC 社区开发者的共同关注，很多人已经加入了它的开发中，预估在一年时间里可能就能推出第一版，可以预料到的是：炒作也将同步发生，BitVM 是目前我最重要的关注点。\n\n——————————————————\n\n总结\n\n对于如上的 BTC 衍生协议进行总结，BRC20、ARC20、Rune、Taproot Assets 作为代币发行协议：\n\n🔹ARC20 的实现最为去中心化，距离原生的 BTC DeFi 最近，具备较大的潜力，但目前炒作关注点不如其他；\n\n🔹Taproot Assets 背靠 Lightning Labs 实力也很强，但由于分发方式的改变，在炒作思路上会发生变化，更注重项目方的格局；\n\n🔹BRC20、Rune 由同一人提出，目前比较依赖 Trac 团队的开发来实现去中心化与生态增长。\n\n对 RGB、Lightning、Stacks、BitVM、RSK 这些 BTC 扩展协议来说：\n\n🔹Lightning 是当之无愧的正统性之王，不过炒作只能基于上述 Taproot Assets；\n\n🔹RGB 虽然看起来“清真”程度很高，但却迟迟无法发布，难以炒作，没人关心；\n\n🔹RSK 与 Stacks 严格说并不是 BTC 原生协议，仅因为占住叙事且流动性好，变成了 BTC 杠杠的好标的，SBTC 的推出也不会真的带来什么生态；\n\n🔹BitVM 吸引了炒作者与 BTC 社区双方的大量关注，是目前最有潜力实现 BTC 生态的协议，但是需要等待，其中也不乏炒作机会，可能是最大的 alpha。\n\n给上序协议基于“清真”排序，分别是：\n\nLightning > RGB >  BitVM > Atomicals > Rune > TaprootAssets > BRC20 > RSK > Stacks\n\n——————————————————\n\n最后\n\n在国债利率高达 5% 的加息周期下，转 POS 的 ETH 作为生息资产的日子并不好过，而有着 pow 原始价值支撑的 BTC 显然更加吃香，ETH/BTC 的汇率持续下跌。\n\nETH 的智能合约平台的地位却并未被撼动，我们依然主要在使用 ETH 智能合约实现的 DeFi、Gamefi 等复杂应用。\n\n但与此同时，BTC 的衍生协议（乃至智能合约协议），正在迎头赶上。\n\n虽然看起来这些协议原始、古老、麻烦和难用，但这依然是历史性的发展机会，BTC 的技术已经积累到足够更进一步，而社区也在逐渐开放，开始接纳衍生的创新。\n\n背靠巨大的开发者基础、资金与关注度，潜力可能远高于任何其他的领域。\n\n会不会在某一种未来里，使用 BTC 智能合约会超越 ETH 的智能合约？"

MARK持有者：代币的每一笔交易/转账都将产生10%的费用，其中5%分配给代币持有者。\n\n4. POL协议拥有流动性：交易费剩余的5%将加池子成为永久LP。\n\n飞轮逻辑：\n\n每当有USDC进入池中时，约85%的USDC将发送到算法金库自动购买 MARK 代币，10%留在池中供用户提取。\n\n当用户的提款金额超过USDC池余额的1%时，算法金库的自动交易合约介入，并出售其持有的 MARK 代币以补充USDC池。\n\n(我的理解这里USDC的投入不同于存款，投入即是一种消耗行为，可提取的是每天高额收益，所以投入USDC的用户需要计算回本周期)\n\n简单来说，池中用户的收益来源于两个部分：\n- 10%原本留下的USDC\n- MARK的增值，算法金库缓慢地出售MARK\n\n$MARK 用户的两部分收益来源：\n- 交易费的5%\n- MARK的增值，算法金库缓慢地购买MARK\n\n🥏\n吸收USDC -> 自动买入 MARK -> MARK 的增值 -> 更高的年化收益 -> 吸收更多的 USDC\n\n同时对于MARK持有者的飞轮影响，即是鼓励长期持有，因为飞轮一旦开始转动，MARK会受到长期的潜在购买力影响，同时流动性深度会越来越好。\n\n飞轮博弈：\n\n对于稳定币的持有者来说，是否愿意把USDC投入到池中，博得一个可能短时间回本的高额APR。\n\n对于degen来说，是否愿意去冲一下可能存在持续被动购买力的一个低市值代币。\n\n这两方博弈又像一个跷跷板，一旦USDC变多，对于MARK的购买力则变多。反过来如果MARK的购买力变多，USDC的投入收益就会变多，熟悉的螺旋上升。\n\n当然这种看似正螺旋的机制也会相伴随负螺旋风险，每个牛市都会诞生新Ponzi，做好自己的研究，Ponzi不会有永恒，只有何时进场何时出场，DYOR。"
